## Usage Instructions

You can invoke these skills by using their name as a slash command or simply asking for them.
For example:
- "Run the /docx workflow"
- "Use the artifacts-builder skill"

**Only invoke a skill when the user uses its exact name.** For example:
- User says "use docx" → invoke the docx skill
- User says "create a Word document" → do NOT invoke the skill automatically

**If you are unsure whether to use a skill, stop and ask the user.**
