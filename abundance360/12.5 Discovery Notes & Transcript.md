## Key Takeaways

- A central objective is to simplify architecture by consolidating member data in HubSpot and reducing reliance on Firebase, where only essential identifiers (contact and deal IDs) are transmitted for processing.
- A transition away from Firebase is underway as the organization has shifted to using HubSpot payments along with invoices and quotes, while evaluating the implications of switching back to a separate Stripe account.
- Membership strategy was detailed with emphasis on an exclusive, tiered model—including virtual, in-person, and elite patron levels—that requires careful handling of multiple membership objects, renewals, and unique event considerations.
- Integration of AI tools was discussed, including leveraging OpenAI for member enrichment and transitioning onboarding assistance and member matching to a more dynamic solution like Peter Bot.
- Next steps were agreed upon by scheduling a follow-up meeting next Monday at 4 PM Eastern, with an option to send additional questions ahead of time to facilitate deeper dive discussions.

    - Review the questions received in advance from Ashley and Michelle and prepare responses (written or video) ahead of the Monday call.

## Membership Management

- Three membership levels are in place: virtual ($11,000), in-person ($27,500), and patron ($55,000), with complexities in handling transfers and renewals.
- Membership upgrades and renewals involve manual start date adjustments, deferred activations, and dealing with multiple membership objects (e.g., platinum) using association labels.

## Data Synchronization Challenges

- Data lives across HubSpot, Firebase, and Airtable, creating syncing issues; efforts aim to centralize the source of truth in HubSpot to reduce redundant manual processes.

## Onboarding & Engagement Tracking

- Automated onboarding leverages AI enrichment to trigger email invites and call bookings, while engagement is tracked by monitoring logins and profile completion.

## Payment Processing Dynamics

- Payment flows shifted from Firebase/Stripe to HubSpot payments, with challenges around applying a $500 application deposit and handling split or partial payments.

## AI Integration with User Experience

- AI tools built on OpenAI support member matching and massive transformative purpose (MTP) determination, with plans to enhance onboarding via Peter Bot integrated into React components.

## Follow-up Meeting

- Next meeting scheduled on Monday at 4:00 PM Eastern Time.

## Technical Requirements

- dashboard
- logging

Meeting is being recorded.

Ashley Burgess
Hey, Teddy. Happy Friday.

Teddy Garcia
Friday.

Ashley Burgess
Sorry about that Zoom link. I don't even know how in 2025, you're allowed to make a meeting without us. I.

Ashley Burgess
Went to start it and was like, wait. There is no button to click. Hold on. All.

Teddy Garcia
Good.

Ashley Burgess
Alright. Well, thank you for joining us. We've got an hour and a half today, so I'm feeling good about being able to cover quite a bit of territory.

Ashley Burgess
But yeah. I mean, basically, it's like, let's are you ready to dive in? Let's.

Teddy Garcia
I I'm ready. Yeah. Are you guys ready? You guys ready to open this can of worms? Sure. Yes.

Ashley Burgess
Yes. All the worms for sure. So I think, really, we wanted to really start off kind of defining all of the systems that are at play here. So I know we've got a lot going on. I wanna make sure that, we have a solid understanding of how each piece is functioning, how they're fitting together, you know, so that we can understand, like, okay. Well, we probably can replace this, all of all of those kinds of questions and goals.

Teddy Garcia
Yep.

Ashley Burgess
So I know we've got Firebase, and that's doing authorization, the Firestore serverless functions, cloud messaging. Anything else or further details to go into there?

Teddy Garcia
No. So, again, just to be clear, so the the Firebase stuff basically runs our our our members' hub, right, which is a stand alone React application pretty much driven by that database. The there are a bunch of serverless functions that were in use previously because we were we were basically running through our own Stripe account and or through. Quickbooks ACH payments. Right? So those were all whenever one of those payments posted, it was getting sent to a Firebase function to figure out, alright, what was the deal? What was the amount? It was determining whether they were a new member or renewing like, all the logic was really kinda encapsulated in that server's functions because it was easier to code there, easier to debug there than it is in in Hubspot's kind of kind of functions.

Teddy Garcia
I personally hate Firebase, and so I'm trying to to move away from that, and again, like, I don't we have now switched to using invoices and quotes and Hubspot's payments properly. There is one question there still around you know, I know once you kinda go down the Hubspot payments route, they make it really hard to switch back to your own Stripe account. But I am wondering whether we should be using our own Stripe account instead of Hubspot payments and if there's any implications of switching that. We don't have any subscriptions that are being auto billed or anything like that. So I don't I don't see it being an issue that way. But I think we having the extra ability to log in to Stripe and and view things, I think, could be valuable. So just any pitfalls or gotchas there if we decide to go down in that route.

Ashley Burgess
Okay.

Teddy Garcia
So let me see what else.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. I'm sorry. I mean, that's the you know, as you saw in the documentation, that's the the core of the Firebase function stuff was around that payment and creating memberships and setting up their accounts and things like that. My my belief is that the hub basically, when when somebody buys, basically, the only thing that needs to be sent to Firebase is a contact ID and and a deal ID, and then instead of all that instead of Firebase querying its own local database for the deal information, it's just querying Hubspot for the contact information and the deal information and doing any logic it needs to do. There's no reason for that data to be synced over there. It might you know, it's not like we're getting hundreds of people that sign up a day. Right? We get, like, 5 people a week if we're lucky. Right? So it's not it's not a big drain on on API.

Ashley Burgess
I think.

Teddy Garcia
What else?

Teddy Garcia
But yeah, and then like I said, the the biggest thing is just.

Teddy Garcia
Because the the bulk of what the hub the member direct member hub site is is basically at the end of the day, it's a blog with, you know, with a bunch of, like, news updates of here's here's what's got I mean, I can show it to you guys because you probably haven't seen it, so that might be helpful just to kinda give you an overview of what it actually looks like and stuff. Hang on a second.

Ashley Burgess
I've only seen what was in some of your presales calls, but, yeah, would love to would love to get a tour.

Teddy Garcia
This is basically it right now. Definitely planning for a redesign because it's very old and outdated. But you know? So you come in, you've got your general updates, which these are just basic basic posts currently being created in Sanity Desk, which I also hate. Like, to me, these could just be blog post. Like, if this was all living in Hubspot. Right? That's kinda what I'm just gonna paint the picture of. If this was all living in Hubspot, how would I how would I architect it and or build it? Either these are just blog posts or custom object or something like that. They get pulled in here. You've the the calendar, which again is very just textual. Like, these things don't even link to anything currently at the moment.

Teddy Garcia
Right? It's just this is when it's Okay. This is when your stuff's happening, and then the majority of the features has to do with the member database. Again, this is all Hubspot data and contact info that is constantly being synced back and forth with all their properties, etcetera. As you might have seen in the specs, there's, like, a 100 different property fields that we keep track of from who they wanna have a beer with to, you know, all of their industries and interests and activities and communities and cities and how many years they've been a member.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. There's some fun ones in there, actually.

Teddy Garcia
What's that?

Ashley Burgess
There's some fun ones in there, actually.

Teddy Garcia
Which may or may not even be being used. That's what I'm saying too. Like, there's a lot of this thing has accumulated a lot of Band Aids and different requests from different project product managers over the years of, oh, we want this. We want this, and stuff gets abandoned and it still lingers in there. Right? So Yeah. That makes sense. But yeah. So, again but so the question is, like, can can something like this be somewhat replicated? Right, and I know it can because I've actually had our overseas developers kinda just start playing around with that as it Like.

Ashley Burgess
With Hubspot CMS? Is that what you mean?

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. Using using React and things like that just as a kind of a a proof of concept of, like, you know, is this possible, and it appears to be. Where is.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. I think the biggest things, like because member directors have built before the search features is, like, the messaging and forms part is what was giving me pause of, like, how could we facilitate that because that's Yeah. Not really something Hubspot does.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So the forms are going away. Okay. So that won't be an issue, and the messaging yes. I agree with you. The messaging would not be part of this, but that's just a question of, you know, can that be a React component that still keeps calling Firebase to handle messaging back and forth. Right? Because the the messaging is still all driven primarily by their by their contact ID. But, anyway, so this was just a proof of concept that a member directory could be built on Hubspot using React from contact records. So.

Teddy Garcia
That kind of thing. But, yeah, you are correct. The the messaging the messaging would have to and I think some of the docs basically state that that the the messaging had to stay external. A lot of the other stuff, though, like, even the you know, like, this event schedule, like, if these can some of this stuff can be pages. Some of it might be custom objects.

Teddy Garcia
That's and that that's what we're trying to figure out. Right? Does it make sense? Is it just easier to keep it as a separate standalone application and keep syncing stuff back and forth. Like.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Some yeah. Some of this totally could be Hubspot because we did the inbound website, so it can be done for a large scale conference.

Teddy Garcia
So you you built the inbound website in Hubspot?

Michelle Tabor
I think it's a couple years ago now. It's the one we did. Oh, that was before my time here, but I know the people who built it are still here.

Teddy Garcia
Got it. Got it.

Michelle Tabor
But, yeah, it can be done, and then one of our other we have a couple other, like, member based clients that are doing stuff like this too.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. Because the other thing that's important to us is also making sure that, you know, the the onboarding stuff and and the engagement thing. Right? So That's the other part. It's like, there's really no tracking or analytics really built into this. Obviously, having this be potentially in Hubspot or Hubspot pages will give us some insights into, you know, what's being used, but more importantly, you know, triggering something when somebody doesn't log in or when they haven't completed their profile. I mean, we could do it now, but I'm just saying that there may be easier ways to do that once if the pages live over there.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Hubspot as a front end is you could do anything with React that you could do with React anywhere else.

Teddy Garcia
Got it.

Michelle Tabor
And then you can, you know, hook into the serverless Hubspot serverless functions to talk to your Firebase store for, like, some of the other things. So you can combine it with a different backend for certain pieces as we need to, it's just Yeah. Technically possible. It's just, like, the minutiae of it.

Teddy Garcia
That's the other thing we're doing a lot of right now is, like, we're not even we don't there's only a few spots in the in the workflows that use custom code. A lot of them are actually using make to call Firebase, I think, for logging and error handling because, obviously, the the custom code blocks in the workflows don't handle that very well. But that's just another key thing to note.

Michelle Tabor
Are you still using NA n? I can never figure out how to say it. N a n.

Teddy Garcia
N a n.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah.

Teddy Garcia
We we're using NAN We don't haven't used it for any of the Firebase stuff yet. I would like to transition a lot of the make stuff to n a n, but the primary stuff is is around enrichment and things like that. So I'm just we we have a concept that we call kind of an epic member, and so when a new application is submitted for membership let me just maybe give you that higher level just so you guys.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. It'd be great. Understand.

Teddy Garcia
What the hell we do. So, you know, we're we're a very, very exclusive community to a certain degree, built and designed for founders, CEOs, high level executives or people that have exited and you know, are now looking for their next big thing, usually running companies 10,000,000 and above, and we have a fixed fixed amount of memberships available primarily due to the the amount of space available at our annual live event. We're contracted with a certain venue for the next 10 years, and they can only fit so many people in the room, period. So because of that, we become highly selective of who we let in, and each year, it's getting the the amount of people the the amount of new people that we're bringing in is becoming smaller and smaller because it just it keeps growing in renewables, and people aren't giving up their seats.

Teddy Garcia
So makes sales and marketing a a lot easier, but does prevent create the problems. But so in general, we have about, I think, 650 members total. There's 3 levels of membership. There's a virtual membership for 11,000 where they can they don't get to attend the annual live event in person. They get to watch it virtually, but they do get all the other community benefits. So it's a year round community. We have workshops and stuff all throughout the year. But all of that is virtual, basically, except for the one live event in March. So 11,000 for virtual, 27 5 for the ability to attend the event in person, and we also have a patron program, which is kind of our just elite group. They get an extra day with Peter or more direct access to Peter, and that's, like, 55,000. So those are the 3 core membership levels.

Teddy Garcia
And like I said yeah. So the application process, when somebody applies, we are checking to determine, know, whether they're, quote, unquote, an EPIC member. EPIC basically being an acronym that means, you know, are they are they doing something having to do with exponential technologies? Are they the type of person that we're looking for? Are we have there's a whole framework that does the enrichment, kinda gives them a score of this person might be qualified, might not be qualified, whatever. It's just maybe before the sales guys are just looking at their Linkedin profile and making a judgment. Now we're trying to kinda create a little bit different algorithm, which is also now being because we're almost sold out in the in the that's not till March, we're almost sold out in December, which is rare.

Teddy Garcia
We're also looking at renewals and determining whether we should allow certain people to renew or not based on whether they still kinda meet that criteria and things like that. So that's mostly what NAN is is handling right now is is that enrichment stuff. There's also stuff, like, just to give you so, again, the the contacts in. Hubspot are the entire member directory.

Teddy Garcia
The for certain certain events, we also do a an $80,000 platinum trip once a year. So this the platinum, it's actually abundance longevity. So it's it's a trip to go learn basically how to live forever from all the people that are working on that science of helping people live forever. It's 80,000. It's ultra high net worth. But for something like that, for instance, that usually rules there's about 70 or 80 people that attend that. That for that, we'll print, like, a a printed member directory, but all that data is coming from Hubspot. So in the past, we've had to, like, export that data from Hubspot, send it over to Airtable, kind of massage it in Airtable, and then from Airtable, feed it back to, like, a CSV that our designers in design can use to kind of generate the book dynamic, the print member book dynamically, things like that.

Teddy Garcia
So just trying to give you kind of this bigger picture of all these systems kinda talking together, but that's that's another big thing as well. So even for this upcoming summit, right, same thing with faculty. Right? The actual speakers of the event, they fill out a speaker intake form that puts them into Hubspot, that creates a contact, that creates a a faculty membership so they get some axe access to the site, and they're visible in the directory. But at some point, we're also gonna take we need to get that data out of Hubspot and get it into a form that it can then be turned into a printed book of who they are and you know, that kind of thing.

Teddy Garcia
So there's a lot of that back and forth data manipulation stuff that would be easier for me if it just lived, in Hubdb and we sync with one thing as opposed to trying to move data to Airtable or Google Sheet or and then having 4 different sources of data where some people are editing in Sheets, some people are editing in Hubspot, and it's constantly out of sync, and one source of truth. That's what I'm trying to get to as much as possible. Yes.

Ashley Burgess
Important.

Teddy Garcia
So I know that was a lot. So you'll I think it's gonna be easier if you guys ask me questions. But.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. We have a whole list.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. I have a couple of follow up questions, and they're kind of going in in different directions. But.

Ashley Burgess
First of all.

Ashley Burgess
Let's see.

Ashley Burgess
Of course, my mind, like, just goes blank as soon as I think about it. I've been, like, holding these questions. So okay. It sounds like you it's fairly exclusive. Right? So people apply. Do they have, like, an application fee for, you know, the salespeople to kind of spend the time going through and qualifying these folks? Is that so is there kind of, like, a a split payment situation? I know that we've been kind of trying to iron out that billing and invoicing.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So Process. So we so we just tested that last month, basically, where they had to they they would apply, and then so it used you know, right, this is a kind of a consistent back and forth with the sales guys. Right? Like, the when when they're not getting enough calls booked, they're like, you guys are adding too much friction to the process, blah blah blah. Right, and then we'd take off the friction, and they're like, you know, now we're getting too many crappy leads. Right, and this is constant back and forth dance. So in it, last month, we did basically set a process where once somebody applied, they were not able to go to the booking form right away.

Teddy Garcia
It ran the AI enrichment. If the AI enrichment determined that they were qualified, then it put them into an email sequence inviting them to book a call with the salesperson. There was a big drop off there was a big drop off there. Right? People weren't booking the calls even though they were qualified, and then we also added the ability to if you felt you were qualified and you wanted to kinda basically skip the skip that process, you could pay $500 and and then book book book a call, which is responsible. Now that created again, created more friction. So I can't say that it worked well, but it also really made the the conversion of those people into a closed deal a challenge in terms of how do we apply that $500 application deposit?

Teddy Garcia
Do we create another deal? When you add it as a line item, it gets kinda wonky to, you know, if you add it to the same deal, you try to add the membership to the same deal. It create gets a little wonky. So, anyways, for the time being, we stopped doing it. Not saying that we won't do it again, and it is something that we need to figure out in terms of that scenario. Like, alright. What's what's the right way to apply this $500, which is basically just a a deposit on the main membership? But Okay. It's already a paid invoice for this other thing that you can't Right. Reapply it.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. Okay.

Ashley Burgess
And I have another question that's really just kind of, scalability based. So it sounds like your, you know, maximum capacity currently is based on the venue size. Right, and you guys I understand you have a contract for several more years. What is the vision for, you know, beyond that contract date? Like, are we are we going to stay limited in size? Is there, you know, the vision to grow even larger? Like, what does that kind of look like?

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So this this event and this community will probably stay limited in size. We are currently looking to do another event called the. Moonshot Summit, which will potentially be in September. That goal of that event is for it to be more like 1,500 to 2,000 people. But that that's it's a sister company that'll have its own Hubspot instance and be outside of this anyways. So Okay. It'll it'll you know, anything that we build here, we'll leverage, but, yeah, it'll be a separate separate clean slate, most likely.

Ashley Burgess
Okay. So this is this is our first pancake.

Teddy Garcia
Yep, and and by the way, that that is another question to to look at and consider is, like, you know, is this thing just such a mess, and is there so much stuff in here that we're not using in fields and properties and workflows and forms that we're never gonna use again and cleaning them out is gonna take longer than just, like, rearchitecting a new instance from scratch. I I don't think it is. I think I think I think a new instance is is a bigger lift, but something to keep in the back of your minds that I'm not not a 100% opposed to, but I'm I'm also not sure what would break if we went that one.

Ashley Burgess
Okay. Yeah. I do know there's there's quite a few contact properties, for example, things like that.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. It's it's common. We see that a lot.

Teddy Garcia
And it's it's from, you know, people that shouldn't have had permission to create forms, creating forms, and they don't know how to.

Ashley Burgess
New fields for every form.

Teddy Garcia
New field for every form.

Ashley Burgess
Yep. Okay. I also wanna kinda dig into the the AI pieces a little bit. Can you kind of explain how all of those different AI pieces are are working? So I know we have some enrichment going on. We have the the member matching. Are there other instances of AI usage that that we wanna we wanna keep?

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So inside the inside the portal, there is code that is basically, when a new member profile is created, it's sending that data to to Pinecone, trying to build a a rag that would be used for for matching. It's not actively being used anywhere. The I mean, it's happening in the background, but it's not it's not a front end for it yet. The other primary AI components are we have this we have we have an what's it called? So we're very big on, basically, every member figuring out, like, what's their MTP, which is their massive transformative purpose. It's like, you know, what are what are you here to do in the world that's kinda really big, and then how do you turn that into a moonshot kinda goal and and plan and and things like that?

Teddy Garcia
So we have these two two AI tools that, you know, basically a type form type thing with some AI behind it that's just kinda helping you figure out, you know, what it is what it is that you wanna do. Now we're we're looking to move that, honestly, to be more driven by Peter Bot, and we're gonna try to integrate Peter Bot more throughout the site both as an onboarding tool, but also to help them with these things. So Peter bought, you know, full AI avatar of Peter, both text, audio, and video. It can even join joins a Zoom meeting and and hop into the conversation if we want them to, and so, yeah, we wanna we're gonna be leveraging more of that versus this form based thing. But, yeah, technically, like, these are all almost, right now, stand alone applications that are somewhat external even to this platform. Okay.

Ashley Burgess
And so, like, on the the Biowriter there, is that kind of form based as well, and then Okay.

Michelle Tabor
Yep. Are these guys are all using at the backend? Is it custom AI, or are you just using, like, a chat GPT connector?

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. Most of them are just using Openai.

Michelle Tabor
Okay.

Teddy Garcia
Peter Peter bought it as a whole custom thing that was built for us by by a third party company. I'll show it to you guys real quick. Just a second. I know.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. What we're dealing with.

Teddy Garcia
But.

Teddy Garcia
Teddy, the last time we explored your vision for transforming the marketing industry with AI, AR and blockchain. Would you like to dive deeper into that or perhaps start refining your massively transformative purpose to guide your next big moves? No, Peter. I just wanted you to kinda meet our our new Hubspot team. It's helping helping us clean up the mess of everything that we've built in Hubspot. Any anything in particular you'd like to see us fix?

Teddy Garcia
Great move bringing in a Hubspot team. That's the kind of infrastructure upgrade that sets the stage for exponential growth. My first question, what's your funnel's biggest leakage point right now? Fixing where leads slip through often delivers the highest leverage. Also, are you tracking your key metrics with clarity so you can iterate fast? Clean data and clear signals are your rocket fuel. What's the biggest pain you're experiencing in Hubspot today?

Michelle Tabor
That is cool and creepy at the same time. That is yeah.

Teddy Garcia
Like, I know that as an AI, but, like, you the the creepy part one for me, very cool. Yeah. The the creep the creepy part is is that, you know, the remembering of what we talked like, I don't even remember what I talked to him about last time. You know? It's like, hey. Last time you were here. But yeah. So. Okay. But, I mean, give given who we are and what we talk about, we need to have stuff like that. So so, yeah, the the more that we can integrate that into the process. But, again, it's kind of a standalone tool.

Teddy Garcia
But it can be integrated with with a React app. Like, Tony Robbins has one as well for his, like, time management system where, you know, basically, it's the same same technology, kinda same company, but it's just like, hey, Tony. Alright. So today, I need to work on this, this, and this, and it'll go into the app and kinda create to dos and and create all the subtasks and provide Tony, like, guidance on how to get it done, whatever. But oh, so.

Ashley Burgess
Thanks.

Ashley Burgess
And so I know you guys have, like, some location based matching and location based filtering, things like that. Is that using that's using Google Maps?

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So, basically, when when the new contact is created, the their address is Google. Google address encoded, and then that determines basically the list of cities that are available.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. From the near name.

Teddy Garcia
Okay. Actually, hang on. Now we do and we do actually want to add, like, a an actual map visualization of that. Yeah. So, basically.

Michelle Tabor
Just a.

Teddy Garcia
Unique list of all the cities based on people's profiles.

Ashley Burgess
Okay. Again, this is So then this is this is pulling cities that are in members' profiles?

Ashley Burgess
Okay.

Michelle Tabor
Just about, like, improvement here, we would, like, want it more map based. Right?

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. Definitely more map based. And.

Teddy Garcia
If you and and ironically, like, it's also if you look at a record in in Firebase, It's actually basing that list off of the Google city, state, country, not even the the actual Hubspot city. So anytime they change their address or change like that, like, this Google thing's gotta run and kinda reindex, basically. But.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah, this is a good example of what what would a record looks like in Firebase of all all the different fields. There are nested records for each of the memberships that the person has has both previous and current, and then all their message history is here as well as multiple subtopics, and so who who are they messaging with, and then what are all the messages that they're that they're having?

Teddy Garcia
I don't even know what the completions and oh, so this is basically status stuff. So, you know, the one thing you'll see in Hubspot is you know, part of the reason there's 1,000 fields on the contact record is a 100 of those fields are these fields. Okay, and you know, at 1., there there is a hub there is a profile custom object in Hubspot. It is not being used. I'm not sure why because, theoretically, that would be the object that contains all these fields. Because, again, there's only 600 records in a database of 200,000 people that need to have all those fields. Right? So why have them on every contact record when only a certain subset of the of the entire contact list needs to have it? Other than it's obviously easier to sort, filter, and query even inside of Hubspot if there are primary contact fields versus a related object fields. That's the only thing I can I can think of as to why it was done that way? But.

Ashley Burgess
Michelle, what direction do you wanna head in next? I know we've got quite a few questions here.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Some of these are, like, in the feed. Some of them are very high level. Where do we wanna go? And.

Teddy Garcia
And and like, so, Michelle, just, again, like, going back to the the chat and messaging thing, like like, a perfect example of a question of, alright. Okay. So we know that this is basically an association to the contact of who are the other people that they're messaging with, and then within those, they're so would it ever make sense in Hubspot for these two PSP custom objects where you have associations to all the people that they're messaging with, and then those things have associations to all the actual message objects? I don't know. Probably not. But I'm just saying, like, it feels it feels like Hubspot could support that data structure whether it's the right thing to do or not. It's a different story. But.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Hubspot, like, structure wise, yes. Scalability becomes a question, especially with record limits Hubspot has introduced with since inbound this year.

Teddy Garcia
Okay. Got it. Yeah. That's what I wasn't sure of.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Because, like, now we're.

Teddy Garcia
This is what I don't know is where where those limits are and where the roadblocks are and where where you can where I'm gonna hit a wall.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Like.

Michelle Tabor
You can have up to 15,000,000 records, but that's only for standard records. But custom objects, which is what, like, these memberships and the chat messages would be. It's 1,000,000 over 10 objects, and then it's, like, $500 a month for an extra million up to 50,000,000 total. So it really, really limits how big your, like, data model can get and how well it can scale. Like Got it. It could do all the front end stuff and store the data is it's it's like is it worth the money to invest all your data there versus storing it in data in, like, Firestore?

Teddy Garcia
And and I do know, like, in other in other CRMs and stuff that I've worked with, like, usually usually, the bigger the database and the more relations and the more tags and all that, the more the whole thing just slows down and grinds to a halt. Is that is that.

Michelle Tabor
True with Hubspot as well? It does. Most portals don't notice it. But if you're getting up here and you have millions and millions of records, then yeah, you start noticing a lag and a delay in, like, the processing of even the API to get the information just because it's so big, and it's, like, probably not the most efficient technology wise.

Teddy Garcia
Got it. Of, like.

Michelle Tabor
How they're storing the data versus, like Wait. What is their what is their underlying database? I'm not sure because they don't expose it. Like, the most they do now is let you connect to Snowflake, and they just copy everything to Snowflake. Gotcha.

Teddy Garcia
Gotcha. Interesting.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. If it was, like, an underlying, like, Mongo or SQL or something, maybe. But it's probably something on AWS. Because anytime AWS breaks, Hubspot breaks. They're probably using some type of database from hub from AWS.

Michelle Tabor
Have to poke some, like I mean Hubspot nerds for it.

Teddy Garcia
Just just so out of curiosity, like, is there if if part of the issue is kinda just this real time sync thing of having the data in both places, is there an easy solution for real time sync between like, a direct connection to the data? Doesn't sound like it except maybe through Snowflake.

Michelle Tabor
And then Snowflake's not real time either. It is delayed, like, 15 minutes and then every 24 hours for some records.

Teddy Garcia
Got it.

Michelle Tabor
The most real time you're gonna get is if you do anything, like, webhook based.

Teddy Garcia
K.

Michelle Tabor
So that becomes, like, one of our main technology limiters. Like, theoretically, yes, it could be done. But is it the most efficient way to do it? Like, things like we're gonna put on our blog, those will be fine. But it's the CRM records themselves I'm concerned about, and then anything that has to go into a hub d b, it has a table limit of 10,000 rows.

Teddy Garcia
Okay. So Yeah. Which It's again, I would the stuff I see in Hubdb would be the faculty faculty members well, not even members. Members are already contact out there. So faculty and the schedule would probably be the two main things.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. So Hubdb is good for dynamic pages like that. Like, we have a schedule, an event list, list of authors, those types of things that don't really change. That's, like, a great use of Hubdb.

Teddy Garcia
But it's not is and it's not relational, though. Right? There's not foreign keys and.

Michelle Tabor
You can add foreign keys to it.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. Okay. I mean.

Michelle Tabor
It looks like it in the UI, but, like, when you pull it, see, like, an API or something, it it gives you the key. So then you have to go look up the other table with the key.

Teddy Garcia
Got it. Got it.

Michelle Tabor
So.

Teddy Garcia
And and and for whatever reason, you still can't like, you just you know? Again, somebody fills out a speaker form. I believe right now, the only way to get that data into Hubdb is through a custom code object. There's no.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah.

Michelle Tabor
Simple. Yeah. There's no simple way, which would be nice.

Teddy Garcia
You would think. Right?

Michelle Tabor
But, yeah, you have to, like, run a a custom code action when a form submitted to then write to the Hubdb table and publish a new version.

Teddy Garcia
And so therefore and so to some degree, Hubdb is not even really solving any sort of sync problem because same thing if if that speaker's contact record changes, I still I don't need to watch and resync to Hubdb anytime a A change happens. So whether I'm syncing to Hubdb or syncing to Firebase is.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Yeah. Right there is, like, pick your voice. Other than that.

Teddy Garcia
I can drive the website dynamic pages from Hubdb.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. You can drive Hubspot, you know, the dynamic pages from the objects too. From, like, the contact objects.

Teddy Garcia
Can you drive it from Firebase?

Michelle Tabor
You can. Yeah. If you had CMS Enterprise, you could drive it from Firebase, and use Firebase as, like, your complete backend.

Teddy Garcia
Interesting. Okay.

Michelle Tabor
I know we went off in a way of a place, Ashley.

Teddy Garcia
No. But that but that's you know, that's No. These are good. It it it just seems like that's you know, what I'm trying to what I'm trying to solve for, I'm not actually gonna solve for because I still have to kinda keep data in sync. Just one one's an internal database, one's an ex external database, but still still the same process.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Like, in this case, it'd be like, where do you wanna where do you wanna do it? Because it still has to be done.

Teddy Garcia
Well, except except for the fact of what you said, which is I don't necessarily have to put the speakers. I don't necessarily have to put the faculty in a Hubdb, I can just make them custom objects or contact records.

Teddy Garcia
So you can you can you can build dynamic pages based on core objects?

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. The biggest limiter here is it has to be a password protected page. So it has to be under, like, the membership options of, because we can't just expose contact data to anything on the open web. It has to be behind a login for contacts, companies, and deals, and tickets for those core objects.

Teddy Garcia
Okay. But if it's a custom object such as a speaker object, then you can?

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Yeah, then you can just put it out on the Internet. Just open.

Teddy Garcia
Got it.

Michelle Tabor
But that you can create those custom object records from a form to now too.

Teddy Garcia
Right. Which is what the other part that I think it feels like it solves. Yeah. So So it gives gives the gives the event team the ability to just edit data and records right inside of the contact record or an associated object that don't have to deal with Hubdb. It gives us the ability to create it from a workflow without custom code, gives us the ability to display it on the website, and it gives us the ability to query it via the API for the for the mobile app as well. That that seems like the route to go.

Michelle Tabor
At least for that one tiny part of this.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah.

Teddy Garcia
But it's a big part because it's you know, it represents the core problem, right, of, like, we need to we need to display the same information in multiple places and in multiple ways without having to try to keep it in sync constantly.

Teddy Garcia
I digress. That was helpful. Thank you.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Let's see. Where should we go here? I think I want to confirm just for my own brain, the general understanding of the goal here of, like, the long term vision for this is to a simplify everything, and are we evaluating if what can be moved to Hubspot, what Hubspot can take on versus something else. Like, I just wanna make sure I'm understanding the goal because I know we just kinda dive straight into details. I'm just now asking us 45 minutes in. I.

Teddy Garcia
I think it's essentially what I just said. Right? It's like, how how do how do we minimize the amount of data that is synced to other databases so that we have one central source of truth and be able to expose that data to as many different user interfaces as possible, whether it's a mobile app for the event, whether it's a private member application, whether. Peter bot needs to access that data and tap into it. Right? So, like because that's even for Peter bot. Like, what what happens in real life when somebody meets Peter is, hey, Peter. Who do you know that can do x, y, or z? Right? Like, like, who can you connect me with? Right, and so for Peter to be able to make member introductions, oh, Teddy, I see you're interested in this, this, and this.

Teddy Garcia
You should connect with this person, this person, or this person who are also in the database. Right, and that's where that that's where the rag would come in. But also, again, that if that member data lives primarily in Hubspot, then as long as there's a way to API into that or to send that to the rag.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. I was wondering if Peter Bot has MCP capabilities because Hubspot's got a pretty decent MCP server. You just connect to it. Yeah. Yep. That'd good, and it has a whole new source.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah, and that and and that that's a great point too. Right? Like, same thing there. Like, from an MCP stand standpoint, if I wanted to connect. MCP to Cloud Desktop and and say, you know, show me all the members who, you know, aren't engaged you know, haven't attended a workshop recently, haven't logged into the portal recently, and are up for renewal in the next 90 days. Like, show me who's at risk kind of thing. Right? Like, that type of query. The more data that is in Hubspot around that, the better because right now, it's not in Hubspot. Some of that data is in Firebase, some of it's in Hubspot, etcetera.

Michelle Tabor
Okay.

Teddy Garcia
But, yeah, that that that's the big focus is how do we how do we centralize, simplify, and still have scalable access to the data through various means.

Ashley Burgess
Okay.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. That this helps me have, like, a guiding point of, like, this is what I'm working towards without getting lost in all the details.

Michelle Tabor
Okay.

Michelle Tabor
Okay, and then I guess, I'm gonna hop down to this question. It's like, do you have, like, reporting requirements that would really drive these decisions? Like, think stakeholders you gotta report to or anything like that.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So there's a couple of thing.

Teddy Garcia
So there's there's two primary reports that we look at. One is this just overall sales and marketing report, which is traffic, contacts, form submissions, you know, where they coming from, what do the what's the the pipeline funnel conversion rates look like over time, and you know, how many how many applications are we how many people are viewing the application, people are submitting the application by week, by day, etcetera.

Teddy Garcia
And then you know, when when do we create most of our memberships, types of memberships, things like that. So for the most part, everything here we'd is good, and then the other part that we look at most is the actual where's Kyle's?

Teddy Garcia
But, I mean, it's very similar to this. Right? So, basically, yeah, how many how many deals are we closing by membership? How do those break down by the membership type? How many calls do the sales guys have in their pipeline? 6 9 8 either. So, again, a lot of these, we don't even.

Teddy Garcia
So how many total members do we have by type? These are basically account account of membership objects. Same thing here, then broken down by price point that they paid. Total members who are expiring within the next 90 days.

Teddy Garcia
It's how many sales calls are booked, that kind of thing. Now the thing that the thing that's a challenge is that. Peter doesn't log in to Hubspot. Peter doesn't have time to log in to Hubspot nor nor would he understand the data. So for Peter, we typically send a a daily sales email.

Teddy Garcia
So this is all generated by make and the so it basically pulls a lot of that data. It's like, alright. We've we sold 96 out of the 150 seats, so we're at 64. There's been two new sales in the past day with so this type of thing where it shows the change between yesterday and today, If there was a way that I can do that in Hubspot easily, and I could just send him that dashboard instead, that would make my life a lot easier. But, like so this is querying to see who are the new people, and then but, yeah, this change from yesterday to today calculation is what necessitates this being built inside of Make, and it's a super complex flow that is basically querying multiple lists to figure out, you know, how many how many do we have today and stores them to to a make data table so that when it looks at it again tomorrow, it can pull yesterday's number and get super super complex for one person, but he's the owner of the company.

Michelle Tabor
Are there any other, like, reporting challenges or things that you wish you could do, but you can't because you've got a data in so many different places?

Teddy Garcia
No. I think that's I mean, other than that and and proper attribution.

Teddy Garcia
And when I say proper attribution, meaning, you know, if you even if you use campaigns, it's gonna give you numbers based on anyone that interacted with that campaign as opposed to, like, the funnel report that would be, like, they did this step and then they did this step. Like, for instance, we our our primary driver of inbound leads and conversions is we'll put out these different meta trends reports on robotics and longevity and the top 10 meta trends. So that's the lead captures and meta trends report. Those people then get invited to a webinar, which is right now just a a replay, and then they get invited to apply. Right, and so. I can't easily tell when when I go look at deal if I wanna see who attended the webinar and then applied, Can only do that through a funnel report, and sometimes that's not accurate, and sometimes it'll include people that were are already members and saw the webinar and wanted to attend it anyways, and so it's like step real funnel step by step attribution, which and as you know, as you create kinda some of those funnel reports, not these, but the other ones, that just the data gets wonky, especially if they skip a step or or things like that, or if they weren't in the very first step, they're not clipping the report at all, and so it's just hard hard to see that accurately. It's the most of these things. Okay.

Teddy Garcia
And then.

Michelle Tabor
Is that because of. Hubspot, or is that because the data lives in different places of, like, they have to go to this other, like, webinar system that the way you're relying on that to sync back so we have that data point?

Teddy Garcia
No. I think it's more just because of the the hubs the Hubspot reporting. So, like, even if I go to.

Teddy Garcia
So, like, this so, like, even there's this waterfall. Right? Like, if somebody doesn't visit the site and they just visit the application page somehow, then you know, they're not being counted and they get excluded from this number, and so if if I create this chart with this as a starting point application page visited, I get a completely different set of numbers. Right? Which, you know, technically technically shouldn't be possible because the application page is part of the site. So, like, how can they not be in this cohort? But, yeah, sometimes in Hubspot's reporting, it seems like they're not. So and then you'll even see this. Right? Like like, the last so last 7 days, it's saying 7 people applied here based on this funnel. But if I look at applications by week, this says there were 17 applications last week, and even this or this one says 6. Although this is this week to date. So.

Teddy Garcia
It's just numbers don't line up.

Michelle Tabor
A lot of times depending how you look at them. But.

Michelle Tabor
Okay.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So those those are the challenges.

Teddy Garcia
And then I mean, there's other stuff that's just kinda like like Hubspot issues. Right? So, like, there's certain reports. Like, if you go look at a form, for instance.

Teddy Garcia
If I go look at a form submission.

Teddy Garcia
Let's take this.

Teddy Garcia
Take a look at this. If there's certain data here that I would love to potentially like, this submissions by source. Right? Like, why can't I save this to a dashboard, and I don't see an easy way to be actually be able to recreate it through the custom dash or maybe there is, but, I mean, I just haven't figured it out of.

Michelle Tabor
Oh, no. That's been on my wish list for, like, 6 years now. So. These form reports. I think I saw a beta, but I haven't tested it yet. But, yeah, form reports has been on the wish list for a long time.

Teddy Garcia
Got it. So I I mean and I get it. I I know there's with any CRM, there's always these teases. Like, do you guys actually use this thing in your own business? Like, how do you not see this as a problem? But.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately, I found out Hubspot uses Looker for all their reporting.

Michelle Tabor
For all their internal reports. I'm like, really, guys? Oh, okay. So let's keep moving here. Ashley, do you have a direction we wanna go? Because I think we've answered most of my questions here at the top in a roundabout way Okay. That some of them aren't really needed because we answered them in other questions.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. We do have quite a few kind of membership, questions and kind of some kind of use cases and scenarios.

Teddy Garcia
Okay.

Ashley Burgess
So let's see.

Ashley Burgess
So are all of your membership changes so, like, whether they're, you know, active, downgraded, all of those, Is that driven by the Hubspot payments? Do you have manual overrides in place?

Teddy Garcia
So, again, we just started using the Hubspot payments. Right, and there are I guess, is that payment based?

Teddy Garcia
I just wanna bring up this record, and then I can help. This this guy's a good example just because he's been a long time member. So he's got lots of different membership objects.

Teddy Garcia
So to answer your question, so there are times when we will manually basically change their start date or end date, particularly start date. Right? So it's like, okay. Yeah. I I wanna be a member, but I don't wanna start my membership till. January because, like, I'm, you know, I'm with my family all of December kind of thing, or we'll get people that, you know, that they can't attend the live event this year, so they wanna defer their membership for a year. They've already paid for it. It's paid in full. They're just not gonna turn it on till till the following year, or they may actually, in some cases, transfer it to somebody else. Okay. As well. Right, and so, yeah, a proper way to deal with that is it would certainly be helpful.

Teddy Garcia
We're we're also running we actually just ran into this thing. Right? So, again, we have we have the core memberships for a 3 60, which are the the vert level one, level two, level 3. Let's just call it. But you'll also see them referred to as virtual, in person, and patron. But then we also have the platinum thing, which is technically a separate event, technically a separate trip, technically a separate community. They don't necessarily get access to the hub. They don't get access to the a 3 60 community. It's a separate thing.

Teddy Garcia
And so in the past, we've kept that as a separate object as this platinum attendees object. There Okay. There's an argument where it should be a membership object. It's just a membership in a different program. But then I just noticed that it's causing a problem because, for instance, in here so, basically, like, our new member communications. Right? Like, when we determine whether somebody's a new member or a renewing member, and the way that we're currently determining whether they're a new member is no. That's not the right one.

Teddy Garcia
Onboarding.

Teddy Garcia
What happened here?

Teddy Garcia
On Zoom.

Teddy Garcia
So the way we'd what used to be happening was and this is a perfect example. So what used to be happening was when the payment came in through Stripe or Quickbooks, that went to Firebase. Firebase determined whether they were a new member or not and fired the custom new member event. Right? That would that would that used to be the trigger for this workflow. Since that wasn't happening, I was like, alright. No. Let me just make a list of new members, and I'll determine, like, who's on that new member list by, you know, whether they have just, you know, one one membership object and you know, start date is less than 60 days ago. The problem is is that we have people that were that have a platinum membership object and an a 3 60 membership object.

Teddy Garcia
So they're technically a new a 3 60 member, but because they have two objects, now this logic doesn't work. Right? So and this is, a calculated roll up field, which can probably be tweaked to only roll up. I know it can be tweaked based on association labels, and that's the other thing that I actually this is a good thing to put a yellow marker around. Like, I need to better understand association level labels and where we need them, where we don't, and how should we best be using them because this is, like, a perfect example of that use case of where if if all the membership objects that were a 3 60 membership objects had that a 3 60 membership association, then I could easily change this roll up field to only count the ones that are a 3 60, not platinum.

Teddy Garcia
Sorry. Have it hold, but this is this is the easiest way I can just kinda, like, surface this stuff and show you kinda all these gotchas that we seem to run into.

Michelle Tabor
Yes.

Ashley Burgess
And what about oh, go ahead, Michelle. I was like, is.

Michelle Tabor
Like, the only thing really automated is the onboarding pieces? Do you have, like, downgrade automations, or does that, like, require somebody to physically step in and like, work on membership?

Teddy Garcia
So no. By by default, when the membership is created, the start date and end date is set for a a year later than their start date, and then anytime the start date changes, the end date changes typically as well. The end date can be changed man like, so this is a this is another scenario. Right? Like, let's say somebody was a level two member, and now they wanna become a level 3 member. Their level two membership technically is still active. It wasn't gonna end for another 6 months, let's say. You know, do we do we set the end date on that level two, the day that they upgraded, and then set the start date of the level 3 to be this today's date plus whatever time they have left plus a year kind of thing. Right, or or do we just change that existing membership object from a level two to a level 3, and right. Those kind of things.

Michelle Tabor
Okay.

Teddy Garcia
But yeah. Yeah. I would make a note of this contact if you just to see one that just has a lot of data in it. It's been a long time member. He's been in all the programs, basically, lots of attendances for different things he's attended, tickets. Like, this is just a good example of contact of. Okay.

Michelle Tabor
And when your renewal is processed, do they have to qualify every year?

Teddy Garcia
So we just started that. Okay. Okay. But so here's here's a good question on renewals. Right? So in the past, what we've done is going into the live event. Typically, at the live event, we will offer some sort of renewal deal. In the past, we've offered what what are called these bundled deals where they're basically committing to they're committing to stay a member for the next. I think it was till 2030 in most cases. Right, and basically, that commitment equated into, a, they locked in their price, and so no matter you know, so we have we have some members that are only paying $10 a year for membership that is now $27.05. We have some that are $20.

Teddy Garcia
So we have people at different levels depending on when they locked in their their bundle price, and they also in order to maintain their bundle, they basically need to pay for that renewal before the event every year. So, basically, they have to renew every year before the event, and then everybody else will still make another offer at the event to kinda renew at at a discounted rate. So in the past, what we have done is we've created deals for every active member at the time of the event and put them in, like, a needs to renew type status, and then you know, if they didn't renew, then at least we knew that. So but, again, that's potentially junking up the data.

Teddy Garcia
Maybe not. I don't know. You know, is is that the question there is, like, is that better to handle in a typical deal pipeline or in a membership pipeline? Right? It's like now you're at the end, and there is a membership pipeline in place. I don't think anybody uses it or anybody knows it's even there, but it does exist. So, you know, for that object does have it. Okay.

Michelle Tabor
For renewals, they're not really automated in the sense of, hey. Here's an email and an invoice. Pay it, and you're good to go for next year. Somebody has to do something to initiate that renewal. Right?

Teddy Garcia
The first the first approach is, yes. Hey. You're up for renewal. Here's a link to go to go pay for your thing. So yes. So so technically, there is a need to create that invoice ahead of time and and let them pay that, which to a degree then also does necessitate creating a deal for it, which that invoice should be attached to, that kind of thing. But.

Teddy Garcia
But I I mean so we do have these stages of for the membership object. But, again, I don't think there's anything tied to them. There's nothing being used. This is what seems like should be the most logical. Like, you know, they're a new member. They onboard. They're active, and they're they're expiring. So at this point, when they're expiring, this is when the sales reps should be kinda reaching out and kinda reestablishing the relationship, and then it either expires or restarts back at renewal, or maybe that's staged in a different this is where I'm looking for best practices in terms of what you guys have seen for something like this, and and that's the other thing to keep in mind. Like, try not to be pigeonholed by what we've got. Try to tell me, like, what you would do if these things weren't in place knowing that there's all these different edge cases, but they're common to any event membership type company to a certain degree.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. So then y'all are making sure that there's not anybody that's attending the event that, you know, their membership could potentially expire, like, during the event?

Teddy Garcia
Typically, yes. Typically, we'll we'll try to get those resolved be beforehand. Okay. But, yeah, there I mean, there could just be a date thing just because the event last year was a few days before or after. Right?

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to make sure that we didn't, you know, need to, like, lock anybody out.

Teddy Garcia
No. I mean I mean, last year was a cluster because, like, again, typically, typically, those people that are on a bundle, they they're supposed to pay before the event, and last year, we were having to do a lot of collections at registrations, which was just, like, really awkward. And.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. You can't come in unless you pay your balance kind of thing. So.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah.

Michelle Tabor
I imagine at that level of clientele, that's not.

Teddy Garcia
No. A good look. That does not look good at all, and and by the way, so, like, I think let me just see. Deal, basically. Yeah. So you'll see you'll see these deal properties for the bundle, like, which which year are they on and I think there's a couple other ones, and so there is some logic based on that as well, meaning, like, you know, if they're on year 3 when they make the payment, then it now needs to increment this to year 4 or or whatever, things like that. So.

Ashley Burgess
And what about, team memberships or multimember? Is that something is that functionality that we're keeping moving forward?

Teddy Garcia
Say that again?

Ashley Burgess
Like, the the team memberships or multi member, like a a group of people purchasing memberships?

Teddy Garcia
So, typically, that that is handled through associations.

Teddy Garcia
John Henry has some no.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So so these people here, I know Cloyd, for instance, this is someone that that John typically pays for. Okay. Which I would think would have usually, it has a label.

Teddy Garcia
Typically, there's a label of this person.

Teddy Garcia
Spouse admin. Yeah. Paid for by. Okay. For. Right. But, again, as you can see, a lot of this stuff sometimes is done manually, and so it's not being applied consistently, and so there's some of this cleanup stuff to do as well. Like, who why is this person an associated contact? Like, they should be able to to recognize that.

Teddy Garcia
And by the way, DAD guest and a d host, basically a d stands for Abundance Digital, which is basically our our livestream version of of the of the thing plus some course material, things like that. So a member can give one, two, or 5 people access to this platform, and this is the Okay. Association for those contacts. Okay.

Ashley Burgess
And then as far as collecting payments for these, like, multi member deals, essentially? Like, do you does it have to be all collected at the same time? Are there partial payment situations?

Teddy Garcia
There's definitely partial there's definitely some invoices that are that are paid partially. Right? Okay, and yeah. So what what I've been telling the sale as we implemented this new system, what I've been telling the sales guys is if they're gonna split it into two payments and and or the second payment is due on a specific date, then use a quote. Otherwise, just use an invoice, and even on the invoice, if they just need to split it across multiple cards or whatever, there's the option to kinda, you know, allow multiple payments on an invoice. I'm assuming that's correct, but that's where I'm also looking for for best practice on that. I mean, there's there's no other reason to use a quote that I've seen other than that and you know, signing it or agreeing to terms, that kind of thing, but we're not really using that a lot.

Teddy Garcia
We're using it more for sponsorships. I mean, that that's the other thing, I guess, to be aware of is, you know, we're starting now to in terms of because we are at a fixed capacity and we still wanna grow revenue, biggest opportunity is on the sponsorship side. So we are starting to build pipelines for for sponsors and that deal flow and things like that, which is. Okay. Simpler, but something to keep in the back of mind as well.

Michelle Tabor
These multi member memberships things, is it all one deal? Like, John's gonna pay for his and Floyd's all on one deal, or will they have their own separate deal for each person?

Teddy Garcia
New question. Yes.

Teddy Garcia
Looks like looks like each person gets their own deal. They certainly get their own membership for sure. But, yeah, I do think they get their own deal as well. Okay. I'm just not sure how that's technically handled. I think the I think the sales reps basically have because, like, what typically happen is let me look at this. There's another person that pays for a lot of people. So let's see. Scott's.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So Scott pays for, like, 10 or 20 people sometimes.

Teddy Garcia
But, yeah, it looks like each of them gets their own deal.

Teddy Garcia
Then.

Michelle Tabor
Like, can you click on a deal? It's like, does the deal have both Patrick and Scott associated to, just Patrick. Okay.

Teddy Garcia
But, again, these were all being done. This was all, yeah, this was all happening before.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah, and that that's a that's a good question too. Right? Well, like, right now, I am associate I am trying to associate the the workflow that I built when a Hubspot payment comes in to mark the deal close and create the membership is is trying to create the associations of the the invoice, the payment, and the membership to the deal, but also to the contact record as well, which and I'm not I'm not sure of the implications of that. Like, is is there an issue with that sort of redundancy of being able to see the association in both places, or is that just a good practice to always associate it to the contact regardless and but also be able to associate to the deal.

Michelle Tabor
No. It's good practice. One thing I've run into with another membership association is they also have, like, where people pay for other people. But they can't actually pull reports based on the deals of, because this deal, we have no we would think, looking at it, that Patrick is the one who paid for it Correct. Because we don't have any of that information. So that's why I brought that up is because that association needed reports of, like, who's actually giving us money versus whose members so they could identify, like, their largest patrons and like, their evangel page patrons because someone who's paying for multiple really believes in the mission.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. Let me see. We do have a contact property called paid for by, but I don't know. Again, it's typically set manually. I don't know. Yeah. You're in the contact record. Yeah. No. It is a it is a contact.

Teddy Garcia
So then you have you have the, contact property and the association label.

Teddy Garcia
Sorry. Maybe it is a deal property. Hang on a second. What's that?

Ashley Burgess
So you have the contact or the the property and the association label?

Michelle Tabor
Okay. We have the association.

Teddy Garcia
Like, we have the association label that's not being used properly.

Ashley Burgess
Okay. Yeah. That was gonna be my next question. I was like, is is the data more accurate on one versus the other?

Teddy Garcia
Let's see here, or do they both need It's some of the deals. Some cleanup?

Ashley Burgess
They they both need it. So it's blank here too. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So right now, this just looks like like Patrick did his own deal.

Michelle Tabor
Okay.

Teddy Garcia
But, you know and I can I can have somebody go through and and clean that up for sure because I mean, there's only there's only a handful of those people that are.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah? I would assume that wouldn't be super heavy cleanup.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. I think that the the volume here is different because you it's, like, 600 members you have. 600 total.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. So I mean, Yeah. Probably about 20 members that might pay for other members.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Yeah. Very manageable. Very manageable versus the other one I was talking about who has 10,000 or Thousands and thousands of members because they're Yeah. The you know, a different type of association. But but but, you know, like, that's a perfect example, right, of.

Teddy Garcia
And this is where a lot a lot of mess comes from. Like, I think the reason the reason that there is both an an association label and a custom field is back to what you just said on the reporting thing. Right? Like, it's almost always easier to report based on a custom field property than it is Association rabbit hole query kind of thing. Right? Like. Like, can you even do that in a rep I assume you can. Right? So you can say, show show me a con show me a list of contacts who are members, and then also drill down and find me all the contacts who are associated to them with this specific label.

Michelle Tabor
You have to do it in a couple different layers, but you could eventually get there. You've had to, like, use 3 different lists to kinda get to there.

Teddy Garcia
Got it.

Michelle Tabor
Because Hubspot only reports on the first association. So if you're trying to get two levels, then you're coming into problems, or if you're trying to report on multiple association level labels, they're just not there yet. So, like, properties are more they're they're the better choice for if you're, like, port. Choice.

Teddy Garcia
But then you need a workflow that's, like, whenever the association label changes to this label, set that property or keep it updated.

Michelle Tabor
Yep, and then you know, some guardrails of for the users of, like, you set the property label or you set the property or you set the association label. You don't set both. Both.

Teddy Garcia
Right. Right. Yeah.

Michelle Tabor
Yeah. Otherwise, you end up with completely different data in each one.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. Which is which is a key problem. Right? So so alright. Cool. I know we only got 5 minutes left. I wanna make sure that we address any other questions. I am curious, though, like, from what you know now, like, are we ahead of the game, or are we too complex? Are we like, compared to other systems and stuff you've seen?

Ashley Burgess
Shell, are you okay?

Ashley Burgess
Bless you.

Teddy Garcia
I tried to breathe the water. Sorry.

Michelle Tabor
Yes.

Teddy Garcia
I do that way too frequently, so I I feel your pain.

Michelle Tabor
But, yeah, Teddy, to your question, like, actually, we've seen a bunch of different associations at a lot of different sizes.

Ashley Burgess
And it feels like you're on the right track.

Michelle Tabor
Especially compared to the one that I've been using for most of my use cases. Like, we've had to talk them into a data model similar like you've implemented with, like, the membership thing because they were tracking it all at the contact record and it was like.

Teddy Garcia
Got it.

Michelle Tabor
Trying to do marketing and membership information, all the same thing. Yeah. I mean, yeah, there's things that can be improved, but you are on the right track from what I'm seeing.

Ashley Burgess
Okay. I've seen, yeah, I've seen much worse, I'll say.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah, and I I think.

Michelle Tabor
Your skill helps a little bit keep this on track because you are able to to test things without it affecting a large swath of membership and people? I mean, large being relative. Like, if we had affected 600 of your members, that's your entire member base. Right. But for the other one, 600 would be a small percentage. So that being relative, you can contest and make sure things actually work out because you're not doing such a high volume.

Ashley Burgess
Yep. Well, I think we got through a lot today. We have quite a few event based questions. So I think our next, call should be focused on, the upcoming event and some kind of use cases around that. So we've got just a couple of minutes left. If we can go ahead and get that on the calendar for next week, I think we'll be in pretty good shape.

Teddy Garcia
And if you you know, happy to do calls, obviously, it's just but as as we just saw, they can go down rabbit holes. So if you if you want to send those questions ahead of time and I can answer some of them in writing or videos or whatever, I can do that as well just to kinda.

Ashley Burgess
Yeah. We can absolutely do that. Quickly.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. You tell me what works for you. I'm pretty wide open. Alright.

Ashley Burgess
Michelle and I have a good bit of time available on Monday if you wanna just go ahead and hit it early in the week, or if you'd like us to send questions ahead of time and give you, you know, a day or two to prepare that, and then you know, we can kind of regroup and and go through anything, or if we feel, you know, we can answer everything confidently async, I think that's fine too.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. I mean, let's let's plan for both. So, I mean, I'm I'm pretty open on Monday except, like, two to 03:30 eastern. Other than that, I'm pretty open anytime after 11, let's say. Okay, and so, yeah, if you wanna do it maybe later in the afternoon, then I can get you I can look at those answers today or over the weekend and send it over. You could look at them Monday morning, and then we can dive deeper into them or whatever.

Ashley Burgess
Okay. What about 3 eastern? Does that work for you?

Teddy Garcia
Do 3 3 02:15 and 03:45. Okay.

Ashley Burgess
We can do 4 eastern if that works for you.

Teddy Garcia
Yeah. I can make 4 work. Okay.

Ashley Burgess
Alright, and I will put a Zoom link in this time.

Teddy Garcia
That was crazy.

Michelle Tabor
Alright.

Michelle Tabor
Well, I have to hop to the another meeting. It's good talking to everybody today, and actually, you'll get that invite sent out for us.

Ashley Burgess
Yep. Finishing up right now. Appreciate you guys. Have a good one. Thank you.

Teddy Garcia
Teddy. We'll see you Monday. Alright. Bye.
