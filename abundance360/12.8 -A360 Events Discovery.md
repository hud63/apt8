## Participants

- Aptitude8: Ashley Burgess, Michelle Tabor
    
- A360: Teddy Garcia
    

## Key Takeaways

- Mark Cetola introduced himself as a new Aptitude 8 team member, having reviewed previous meeting recordings to get up to speed.
- HubSpot is affirmed as the primary source of truth for deal, membership, and profile data with Firebase serving as a syncing intermediary.
- The payment process involves reconciling HubSpot payments with QuickBooks while managing complexities in reporting and custom Stripe integrations.
- Integration and authentication discussions centered on moving towards HubSpot-based logins and CMS functions to reduce redundancy and minimize API calls.
- Plans were mentioned to refine large workflows into smaller, dedicated subroutines for better error handling and easier maintenance, with a pipeline workshop and asynchronous documentation as next steps.

## Action Items

- Ashley Burgess
    
    - Deep dive into the deal pipelines and develop detailed questions regarding the deal flow process and payment integration, and review the related sales process documentation.
    - Plan and schedule a pipeline workshop (with an option for asynchronous input such as a Loom video) to review the deal pipelines and payments questions.
- Michelle Tabor
    
    - Develop documentation with charts and diagrams outlining a recommended fresh build of the system, detailing how to leverage HubSpot’s native features versus custom solutions.
- Teddy Garcia
    
    - Double-check with the sales and support team regarding the membership upgrade process to confirm if upgrade payments should be prorated or billed at full price.
    - Locate the detailed 'sales SOP' document and reshare it with the team.

## Member Data Management

- HubSpot remains the source of truth for profile, deal, and membership data with real-time sync from the member hub despite some redundancy with Firebase.

## Membership Upgrade Process

- When a membership is upgraded, the original membership end date is set to the upgrade decision date, and a new full-priced membership record is created without proration.

## Notifications Management

- The system uses push notifications via a mobile app (Expo) and email notifications via Postmark, but lacks robust subscription preference management.

## CMS Implementation Preferences

- There is a clear preference to shift CMS functions into HubSpot to streamline member newsletters and content archiving using built-in tools.

## Workflow and Automation Strategy

- Concerns were raised that monster workflows slow performance and complicate error recovery, suggesting segmentation into smaller workflows for tasks like sending emails.

## Technical Requirements

- logging
- monitoring
- Stripe
- tracing
- webhook

## Workflow

# 12.8 - A8 // A360 Events Discovery

Mon, 08 Dec 25

### Current System Architecture & Data Flow

- **HubSpot as Central Hub**
    
    - Primary source of truth for profile data, membership records, and transaction history
        
    - Deal creation triggers Firebase sync via Make automation platform
        
    - Payment links previously generated through custom Stripe integration stored in Firebase
        
    - Current HubSpot Payments integration has stripped out most Firebase payment logic
        
- **Firebase Authentication & Access Control**
    
    - Handles login across all applications (email/password + magic link options)
        
    - User ID likely generated by hashing email address (requires verification)
        
    - Access levels stored redundantly:
        
        - On Firebase user object directly
            
        - Within nested membership objects under user collection
            
        - Creates performance issues requiring multiple API calls for permission checks
            
- **Data Synchronization Challenges**
    
    - Bidirectional sync between HubSpot and member hub for profile updates
        
    - Real-time syncing works but creates “moving target” for source of truth
        
    - Manual Firebase edits avoided to preserve sync integrity
        
    - Airtable used for longevity trip speaker data didn’t sync back to HubSpot
        
    - No validation process to ensure data consistency across systems
        

### Integration Pain Points & Error Management

- **Make Automation Platform Issues**
    
    - Most data conflicts and sync errors occur in Make workflows
        
    - HubSpot contact search failures when additional email fields exist
        
        - Search by primary email returns “not found”
            
        - Attempt to create contact fails because contact exists in additional email field
            
    - Better error notifications and step-by-step logging than Firebase Cloud Functions
        
- **HubSpot Webhook Limitations**
    
    - Public webhook endpoints have no outbound rate limiting
        
    - Can fire hundreds/thousands of webhooks simultaneously
        
    - Risk of overwhelming receiving endpoints causing silent failures
        
    - Private app webhooks offer throttling but require beta feature access
        
    - Current setup uses mix of Make workflows and direct cloud functions
        
- **Missing Error Monitoring**
    
    - No centralized error tracking platform (Sentry recommended)
        
    - Firebase Google Cloud logging described as “useless”
        
    - Difficult to debug custom code in HubSpot workflows
        
    - Need better visibility into where contacts are in automated processes
        

### Payment Processing Evolution & Challenges

- **Recent Migration Impact**
    
    - Moved from custom Stripe integration to HubSpot Payments
        
    - Lost detailed transaction breakdown capabilities
        
    - HubSpot sends $100K lump sum without clear order/product attribution
        
    - Built custom report in HubSpot’s data solutions for better visibility
        
- **Payment Method Complexity**
    
    - Wire transfers require manual intervention:
        
        1. Finance team receives wire notification
            
        2. Sales team manually marks invoice as paid
            
        3. Triggers membership setup automation
            
    - Legacy quotes vs. invoices system:
        
        - Quotes: for split payments over time (deposit + balance due later)
            
        - Invoices: single payment or immediate multi-card splits
            
    - Cannot generate unified accounts receivable report across quotes and invoices
        
- **Pricing Structure Challenges**
    
    - Bundle memberships have varying renewal amounts based on enrollment year
        
        - 5-year bundle members: $10K renewal
            
        - Current bundle members: $20K renewal
            
        - Creates SKU proliferation vs. discount application debate
            
    - Mid-year upgrades charge full price without proration
        
    - Membership end-dating and time extension logic for upgrades
        

### Membership Management & Access Control

- **Current Upgrade Process**
    
    1. End-date existing membership on upgrade decision date
        
    2. Create new membership record with higher level access
        
    3. Extend end date by remaining time from previous membership
        
    4. Customer pays full amount for new level (no proration applied)
        
- **Access Level Architecture**
    
    - Firebase membership objects contain access permissions
        
    - Redundant storage on user object for performance
        
    - Historical membership tracking for portal display (“member in 2024, 2025, 2026”)
        
    - HubSpot rollup fields calculate membership years automatically
        
- **Administrative Capabilities**
    
    - No admin user impersonation in current member hub
        
    - Desired: ability to log in as member to troubleshoot issues
        
    - Event check-in app has separate admin user concept
        
    - Future CMS needs admin interface for content management
        

### Content Management & Communication Systems

- **Current CMS Fragmentation**
    
    - Sanity CMS for main content management
        
    - HubSpot for email marketing and workflows
        
    - Desire to consolidate everything into HubSpot platform
        
    - Weekly member newsletter archive needed in member portal
        
- **Communication Infrastructure**
    
    - Mobile app: React Native web view with push notification support (Expo service)
        
    - Email notifications via Postmark for member-to-member messaging
        
    - Push notifications for event news/announcements through Sanity
        
    - No subscription preference management currently implemented
        
- **Content Strategy Opportunities**
    
    - YouTube connector integration for video archive display
        
    - Blog-to-newsletter automation possibilities
        
    - Podcast support exploration needed
        
    - Social media content syndication potential
        

### Field Governance & Database Management

- **Current Access Controls**
    
    - Mark: sole access to Firebase field additions and schema changes
        
    - Kyle, Andrew (HubSpot partner): can add HubSpot fields
        
    - Development team: can add fields with approval
        
    - Temporary moratorium on changes during system evaluation
        
- **Database Cleanup Hesitation**
    
    - Recent deletion of 5-year-old forms caused tracking issues
        
    - Contact source attribution lost when forms deleted
        
    - Fear of breaking interdependencies prevents aggressive cleanup
        
    - Need better documentation of field usage and relationships
        
- **Technical Skill Gaps**
    
    - React/Firebase learning curve for PHP/WordPress background
        
    - Heavy reliance on AI tools for modern JavaScript development
        
    - Enterprise-level tool awareness gaps (Sentry, advanced monitoring)
        
    - Need for better debugging and development workflow tools
        

### Compliance & Risk Management

- **Data Privacy Approach**
    
    - GDPR compliance not actively monitored (“been a joke in my opinion”)
        
    - Member communications opt-out rarely honored due to payment relationship
        
    - Cookie banner fatigue but no systematic consent management
        
    - Re-opting members into communications for critical announcements
        
- **Financial Reconciliation**
    
    - QuickBooks integration required for accounting
        
    - HubSpot Payments reporting insufficient for detailed reconciliation
        
    - Considering return to own Stripe account for better reporting
        
    - Wire transfer manual processing creates audit trail gaps
        

### Future State Vision & Open Decisions

- **System Consolidation Goals**
    
    - Single source of truth in HubSpot for all member data
        
    - Firebase potentially reduced to authentication only
        
    - All CMS content moved to HubSpot platform
        
    - Streamlined admin interface for troubleshooting and management
        
- **Outstanding Technical Decisions**
    
    1. HubSpot authentication vs. Firebase authentication retention
        
    2. Custom Stripe account vs. HubSpot Payments for reporting
        
    3. SKU proliferation vs. discount strategy for pricing variations
        
    4. Monster workflow vs. modular workflow architecture
        
    5. Error monitoring platform implementation (Sentry recommended)
        
- **Workflow Architecture Debate**
    
    - Current recommendation: single large workflow for complete process visibility
        
    - Alternative approach: modular workflows with orchestrator pattern
        
    - Considerations: debugging capability, performance, reusability, error recovery
        
    - Need for transaction-like rollback capabilities in HubSpot workflows
