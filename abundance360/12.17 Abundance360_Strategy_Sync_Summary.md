| **Questions** |
|---------------|
| **Build Strategy Recommendations\
✅ Recommendation from A8**

- Do NOT rebuild the frontend in HubSpot CMS
  - This is "one of the most advanced builds proposed on the CMS" in 4-5 years
  - Risk of platform limitations not yet known
  - Labor intensive with uncertain ROI

- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Install HubSpot tracking code on current Firebase app
  - Build a "hyper robust data synchronization pipeline"
  - Let HubSpot do what it's good at (marketing, CRM)
  - Let the app do what it's already designed to do

**✅ HubSpot React Theme Capabilities**

- Front-end React development:
  - Works like any other React development environment
  - Can install packages normally
  - No significant front-end limitations

- Islands architecture:
  - Hydrating components with CRM data is "a little over-complicated"
  - Different than a normal React app

**⚠️ Backend Limitations**

- HubSpot serverless functions:
  - 15-second timeout limit
  - Processing bottlenecks
  - Not suitable for heavy data manipulation

- Alternative: Can connect to Firebase cloud functions instead
  - More flexibility for backend processing
  - No HubSpot timeout constraints

**Object Schema Architecture\
✅ Profile Object Recommendation**

- Consolidate to Contact record
  - Profile object exists but not currently in use
  - Can be completely removed

- Properties on Contact:
  - Use conditional display (only show if member)
  - Lock properties by teams/permissions
  - Simplifies querying (no nested associations)

**⚠️ Membership Object Structure**

- Current membership types:
  - A360 Virtual Member
  - A360 In-Person Member
  - A360 Patreon Member
  - Ascend
  - Teams

- Platinum Attendee:
  - Currently separate object (buying a trip, not membership)
  - Could potentially be a membership type
  - Segmentation issue: New vs returning member calculation
    - Counts Platinum + A360 memberships together
    - Workaround: Nested lists or dual rollup fields

**✅ AD Memberships (Digital Course)**

- Purpose: Track license distribution
  - One A360 member can give 3-5 licenses to team members
  - Tracks who received access from which member

- Current status:
  - Not actively reporting on this data
  - Could use contact-to-contact associations instead
  - No strong recommendation either way

- Access lifecycle:
  - Provisioned via form submission in member hub
  - Access granted for one year
  - ⚠️ Currently NOT revoking access when primary member doesn't renew

**Contact-to-Contact Associations\
✅ Currently In Use**

- Payer relationship: Who paid for team licenses
- Referral tracking: Member-to-member referrals
- Assistant relationship: Critical for outreach
  - Often need to email assistant instead of CEO/founder

**✅ Association labels working well for:**
- Relationships that need reporting
- Relationships referenced frequently

**⚠️ HubSpot association label limits:**
- Not great at grouping
- Reporting limitations

**Deal & Membership Association Patterns\
✅ Recommended Association Model**

- Memberships should associate to:
  - Deal (for financial recording)
  - Contact who purchased
  - Actual member (if different from purchaser)

- Rationale: Track payment source separately from membership holder

**✅ Deal Structure for Multi-Seat Purchases**

- One deal with multiple memberships (not multiple deals)
- Example: Company buys 10 seats = 1 deal → 10 memberships
- Accounting benefit: One bank transaction = one deal marked paid
- Associates to all 10 contacts receiving memberships

**⚠️ Workflow Complexity**

- Memberships created when deal invoice is paid
- Must associate all receiving contacts to deal BEFORE close
- Alternative: Store all email addresses/member IDs in a field
- Edge case handling:
  - Lapsed member returning: Same member ID or new?
  - Each renewal creates new membership record

**Membership Date Logic\
⚠️ Complex Renewal Scenarios**

- Example: Member renews in December for 2027
  - Current membership ends June 2026
  - New 2027 membership starts June 2026
  - Payment received now

- Deal closes won now, membership starts in future
- Start/end dates need adjustment for overlapping memberships

**Workflow Architecture Philosophy\
✅ A8 Recommendation: Modular Workflows**

- NOT monolithic "monster" workflows
- Benefits of modular approach:
  - Easier debugging
  - Lower blast radius on failure
  - Targeted re-enrollment possible

**Custom Coded Actions vs External Functions\
✅ Custom Coded Actions Preferred When:**

- Need advanced workflow triggers
  - Example: Unsubscribe trigger (no webhook available)
- Need to return values for subsequent workflow steps
- Processing fits within limits

**⚠️ Custom Coded Action Limits:**
- 15 seconds execution time
- 5 megabytes data

**✅ Use External Functions When:**
- Generating PDFs
- Processing large datasets
- Need longer execution time

**Webhook Behavior\
⚠️ Important Limitation**

- HubSpot webhook action:
  - Does NOT wait for response
  - "Sends it out into the void"
  - External process must webhook BACK to continue flow

**Tooling & Integration Recommendations\
✅ Data Sync Tools**

- **Windmill.dev** (Recommended)
  - Self-hosted, open-source
  - Drag-and-drop flow builder
  - Write actual code (scripts)
  - Native connections to systems
  - Import any packages needed
  - Full control over codebase
  - Can use Firestore package directly (read AND write)
  - Free open-source license sufficient
  - Enterprise licenses available (not expensive)

**⚠️ Tools with Concerns:**
- **Make**: "Not the most amazing"
- **Pipedream**: Just bought by Workday - future uncertain
- Other sync tools: Often expensive ($thousands/month) or limited (e.g., can't write to Firestore)

**✅ Error Logging**

- **Sentry** recommended for HubSpot
  - Works well with HubSpot
  - Must program custom coded actions to send to Sentry
  - Not automatic - requires explicit integration

**⚠️ Current Pain Points:**
- HubSpot Data Studio sync failures:
  - No error logging
  - No visibility into why syncs fail
  - Example: Simple speaker dataset → Google Sheets sync failing silently

**HubDB Assessment\
❌ Not Recommended**

- "Just another thing to keep in sync"
- Moving problems to different location
- Less visibility and transparency than current setup

**Engagement Next Steps\
✅ Confirmed Deliverables**

- General schema review
  - Flag anything "completely out of whack"
- Workflow documentation review
  - Key workflow: Deal won → membership setup → Firebase sync
  - Check logic for gaps or unnecessary steps

**⚠️ Hours Discussion**
- Client requested hours usage summary
- May allocate remaining hours to:
  - Data processing gap analysis
  - Risk and dependency planning
  - Open consulting hours for ad-hoc questions

**Executive-Level Takeaways**

- HubSpot CMS rebuild is NOT recommended
  - Too complex, too risky, uncertain ROI
  - Better to optimize current Firebase app + HubSpot integration

- Focus investment on data synchronization pipeline
  - Install HubSpot tracking on existing app
  - Build robust, reliable sync between systems

- Object schema is mostly sound
  - Profile object can be removed
  - Keep memberships as single object with type property
  - Use conditional properties and permissions for complexity

- Workflow architecture needs modernization
  - Move from monolithic to modular
  - Use custom coded actions where possible
  - External functions for heavy processing

- Tooling gaps are addressable
  - Windmill.dev for data sync flows
  - Sentry for error monitoring
  - Both are cost-effective options

- Organization is technically capable
  - Clear understanding of limitations
  - Willing to make architectural decisions
  - Focused on "is the juice worth the squeeze"
