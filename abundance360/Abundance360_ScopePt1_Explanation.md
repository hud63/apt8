## Scope & phases
- **Mobilization:** Prep for engagement kickoff (uses intro/reverse demo recordings, PRD, existing call notes); small effort.
- **Discovery:** Four interviews � executive/overview, event operations, technology, and an integration/architecture review � to map the business, event data lifecycle, and current stack constraints.
- **Technical analysis:** Review integrations and architecture; inspect Firebase, HubSpot, marketing apps, workflow tools, data layer, and reporting to find risks/dependencies.
- **Analysis:** Compare current vs desired state across data, operations, and reporting to identify gaps and quick fixes.
- **Planning & roadmap:** Build risk/dependency register with mitigation/owners; outline next steps.
- **Documentation:** Produce a findings readout for leadership with exec-level summary of interviews and analysis.

## Assumptions called out
- Interviews generally include ~1 hr prep, ~1 hr conduct, ~1 hr summary; advisory depth only.
- Architecture review includes one working session with Head of Technology and a light test of syncing basics.
- Gap analysis includes one internal review cycle and highlights quick wins.
- Readout includes draft + final and a 60�90 minute delivery session.

## Hours & investment
- Estimated hours (low/high): **26 / 44**.
- Contracted hours: **37**.
- Estimated investment: **12,025** (currency not specified).

## Ownership/context notes
- Strategy leads mobilization, exec/event interviews, roadmap, and readout.
- Solutions Engineering leads tech interview, architecture review, gap analysis.
- Internal notes: one row per business process; ensure at least one 60-minute meeting for low-complexity reviews; must link to record-count table for analysis.
