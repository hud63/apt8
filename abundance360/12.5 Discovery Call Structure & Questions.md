## Part 2: Questions Verbatim

**Ashley Burgess**
*   "Are you ready to dive in?"
*   "So I know we've got Firebase, and that's doing authorization, the Firestore serverless functions, cloud messaging. Anything else or further details to go into there?"
*   "With Hubspot CMS? Is that what you mean?"
*   "So it sounds like it's fairly exclusive. Right?"
*   "Do they have an application fee for the salespeople to spend the time going through and qualifying these folks?"
*   "Is there a split payment situation?"
*   "What is the vision for beyond that contract date?"
*   "Are we going to stay limited in size?"
*   "Is there the vision to grow even larger?"
*   "What does that look like?"
*   "So this is our first pancake?"
*   "Can you explain how all of those different AI pieces are working?"
*   "Are there other instances of AI usage that we wanna keep?"
*   "And so on the Biowriter there, is that form based as well?"
*   "Is that using Google Maps?"
*   "So then this is pulling cities that are in members' profiles?"
*   "Michelle, what direction do you wanna head in next?"
*   "So are all of your membership changes... whether they're active, downgraded, all of those, Is that driven by the Hubspot payments?"
*   "Do you have manual overrides in place?"
*   "So then y'all are making sure that there's not anybody that's attending the event that their membership could potentially expire during the event?"
*   "And what about team memberships or multimember? Is that functionality that we're keeping moving forward?"
*   "The team memberships or multi member, a group of people purchasing memberships?"
*   "And then as far as collecting payments for these multi member deals, essentially?"
*   "Does it have to be all collected at the same time?"
*   "Are there partial payment situations?"
*   "So you have the contact or the property and the association label?"
*   "Is the data more accurate on one versus the other?"
*   "I would assume that wouldn't be super heavy cleanup?"
*   "Shell, are you okay?"
*   "Michelle and I have a good bit of time available on Monday if you wanna just go ahead and hit it early in the week, or if you'd like us to send questions ahead of time and give you a day or two to prepare that, and then we can kind of regroup and go through anything, or if we feel we can answer everything confidently async?"
*   "What about 3 eastern? Does that work for you?"
*   "We can do 4 eastern if that works for you?"

**Michelle Tabor**
*   "So you built the inbound website in Hubspot?"
*   "Are you still using NAN?"
*   "Are these guys all using at the backend? Is it custom AI, or are you just using a chat GPT connector?"
*   "Just about improvement here, we would want it more map based. Right?"
*   "Where do we wanna go?"
*   "Wait. What is their underlying database?"
*   "In this case, where do you wanna do it?"
*   "Are we evaluating if what can be moved to Hubspot, what Hubspot can take on versus something else?"
*   "Do you have reporting requirements that would really drive these decisions? Think stakeholders you gotta report to or anything like that."
*   "Are there any other reporting challenges or things that you wish you could do, but you can't because you've got data in so many different places?"
*   "Is that because of Hubspot, or is that because the data lives in different places... that the way you're relying on that to sync back so we have that data point?"
*   "The only thing really automated is the onboarding pieces?"
*   "Do you have downgrade automations, or does that require somebody to physically step in and work on membership?"
*   "And when your renewal is processed, do they have to qualify every year?"
*   "For renewals, they're not really automated in the sense of, hey. Here's an email and an invoice. Pay it, and you're good to go for next year. Somebody has to do something to initiate that renewal. Right?"
*   "These multi member memberships things, is it all one deal? Like, John's gonna pay for his and Floyd's all on one deal, or will they have their own separate deal for each person?"
*   "Like, can you click on a deal?"
*   "Your skill helps a little bit keep this on track because you are able to test things without it affecting a large swath of membership and people?"
