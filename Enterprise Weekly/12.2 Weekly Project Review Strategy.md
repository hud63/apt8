### Blockers and Risks

- Capacity constraints affecting project scheduling and new deal acceptance
    
    - Rev Prep project delayed due to Michelle’s unavailability to take on new work
        
    - Multiple December closes creating resource allocation challenges
        
- VA opportunity facing strong competition with 8+ vendors responding to RFP
    
- Green X and Caveo deals on hold due to Matt’s absence, requiring Taron to pick up Green X calls
    
- FNF deal moving slowly, pending November board meeting outcome
    
- Client availability issues during holiday period (TailGlass out December 19 - January 5)
    

### Next Steps and Actions

- Taron to follow up on Green X opportunity this week after picking up from Matt
    
- Casey to present Whistle Express scope on Friday and push for December close
    
- Ashley to determine final Rev Prep timeline after weekly client meeting
    
- Team to prepare for multiple January kickoffs given expected December closes
    
- Monitor capacity planning closely due to anticipated deal volume
    
- Create phase two deal for Sam Abundance 360 to facilitate proper planning and resource allocation
    
- Update project end dates based on realistic timelines and resource constraints
