# 1.6 Weekly Project Review Strategy

Tue, 06 Jan 26

### Pipeline Overview and Revenue Forecasting

- Major strategy deals in pipeline with significant revenue potential
    
    - Coveo: $77,000 engagement
        
    - JLG: $125,000 engagement
        
    - Whistle: $45,000 engagement
        
    - Additional deals: TIC (longer timeline after morning sales call), VA FB, Whistle Express
        
- Capacity concerns with simultaneous deal closures
    
    - Only takes 2 major deals (like JLG + VA FB) to create “tough spot” with bandwidth
        
    - If all 3 major deals close, team would be “pretty good” but need Whistle Express too
        
    - Challenge: sales team operates with “quick moving strategy” approach, expecting immediate readiness
        
- Timeline expectations for January closures
    
    - Most realistic: Whistle Express and VA FB
        
    - TIC will take longer based on morning sales call assessment
        
    - Constantly receiving “quick moving strategy” requests from sales via Slack
        
- Sales team coordination improvements
    
    - 2-hour training session scheduled later today
        
    - Teaching sales team methodologies and project timelines
        
    - Providing forecasting sheet for sales to update deal status
        
    - Goal: better communication on realistic timelines vs. “close by this time” pressure
        

### Current Project Updates and Timelines

- Rev Prep project scope changes
    
    - Major development: new HubSpot admin hired by client
        
    - Dev scope completely removed, dramatically reducing project complexity
        
    - New admin can handle internal work, reducing external needs
        
    - Call scheduled immediately after this meeting with new admin
        
    - Next steps: define what admin vs. agency will handle, refine scope accordingly
        
    - Timeline: January 16th completion (acknowledged as optimistic but maintaining hope)
        
    - Project classification: moved from enterprise to core project level
        
- Abundance retainer management
    
    - Client contact before holiday break: Teddy confirmed he had everything needed
        
    - Friday meeting scheduled to discuss remaining retainer usage
        
    - Status: waiting for client direction on how to spend remaining hours
        
    - Relationship: positive, proactive scheduling for new year planning
        
- Tailglass project transition and resource allocation
    
    - Major change: Ashley taking over as project lead after building original scope
        
    - Internal kickoff meeting scheduled for tomorrow
        
    - Resource assignments confirmed:
        
        - Bench players: Danny and Vas for primary support
            
        - Zach available for dev work (minimal scope, may not need inclusion in kickoff)
            
    - Project advantages: Ashley built the scope, ideal for continuity
        
    - Risk management: throwing Ashley “in the fire” but with full team support commitment
        
    - Expectation: Ashley must communicate transparently about bandwidth and support needs
        

### Team Capacity and Resource Planning

- New team member onboarding
    
    - Tallinn started today with positive first impressions
        
    - Client feedback: “you guys are so organized”
        
    - Onboarding process executed well despite some calendar/email access delays
        
    - Background: originally applied for strategy role, potential resource for overflow work
        
    - Immediate availability: too premature but available for future capacity needs
        
- Capacity management philosophy
    
    - Team has sufficient people and resources for foreseeable workload
        
    - Strategy: leverage team members across projects for support when needed
        
    - Confidence level: “we’ll be just fine” even with heavy pipeline
        
    - Bigger concern: ensuring deals actually close rather than capacity overload
        
- Ashley’s expanded role and support structure
    
    - Taking on significant new responsibility with Tailglass
        
    - Commitment: full team support and accountability for her success
        
    - Methodology: transparent communication required about challenges
        
    - Historical learning: looking back to avoid repeating past mistakes
        
    - Support available: as much or as little PM/AM involvement as needed
        

### Ongoing Project Statuses and Dependencies

- Tao Class project (second phase completion)
    
    - Critical dependency: waiting for Michelle on integration piece

    - Client milestone: board meeting presentation in February
        
    - Support offered: slide creation or repurposing existing presentation materials
        
    - Status: project progressing well overall
        
- Pipeline tracking and forecasting systems
    
    - Current method: manual spreadsheet for capacity planning (temporary until Rocket Lane)
        
    - Rob’s original forecasting tool being utilized for revenue projections
        
    - Rocket Lane implementation pending for proper resource allocation tracking
        
    - Goal: automated hours per week and resource allocation visibility
