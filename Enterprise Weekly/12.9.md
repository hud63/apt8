# 12.9 Weekly Project Review_ Strategy

Tue, 09 Dec 25

### Current Pipeline Status

- Pipeline is currently heavy with multiple active opportunities at various stages
    
- Beginning to see typical year-end delays with several prospects pushing decisions to January
    
- Two significant fast-moving opportunities emerged: LiquidNet (for the right team) and JLG (for strategy)
    
- Whistle and Justin/Fidelity both cancelled meetings and pushed discussions to New Year
    
- Strategy services experiencing typical Q4 slowdown but expecting significant January demand surge

    - Will close by end of year with January 2026 kickoff
        
    - Megan sent SOW today
        
    - Positioned as urgent due to January strategy waitlist
        
- **JLG**: Major new opportunity for digital transformation

### Blockers and Risks

- Year-end decision fatigue affecting multiple prospects
    
    - Whistle cancelled Friday scope review, postponed to New Year
        
    - Justin/Fidelity also pushed timeline despite previous WFG success
        
    - Strategy prospects particularly hesitant to start new initiatives
        
- Resource allocation concerns with large deals
    
    - JLG’s 300+ hour scope could impact capacity for smaller/slower opportunities
        
    - January strategy demand surge may create bottleneck
        
- Trend client (Ashley) continues rescheduling meetings
    
    - One month of meeting changes becoming problematic
        
    - Final opportunity this week before cutting ties
        

### Next Steps and Actions

- **Green X**: Monitor for signature this week to secure January strategy slot
    
- **JLG**: Complete proposal preparation for Scott by tonight
    
    - Review all provided recordings and materials
        
    - Finalize scope and pricing for quarter-million-dollar engagement
        
- **TeaCow**: Follow up tomorrow for Phase 1 signature
    
    - Phase 2 scope development continues for January start
        
- **ASUS**: Track SOW signing progress with Adam
    
    - Continue workshop activities under retainer hours
        
- **Trend**: Final outreach to Ashley this week
    
    - End engagement if no meeting scheduled by Friday
        
- **Pipeline Management**: Prepare for January strategy rush
    
    - Communicate urgency of year-end signings for January slots
        
    - Monitor capacity planning for Q1 2026 demand
