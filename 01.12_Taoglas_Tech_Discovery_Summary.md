| **Questions** |
|---------------|

**Multi-Distributor Deal Architecture**
**✅ Proposed Solution: Custom "Distributor Bid" Object**

- **Problem**: SAP allows only one distributor per quote, but Taoglas often gets quotes from multiple distributors for the same project. Creating multiple Deals in HubSpot for each distributor skews forecasting and pipeline reporting.
- **Solution**: Implement a "Distributor Bid" custom object as a child of the Deal object.
  - **Deal Object**: Represents the overall opportunity/project container.
  - **Bid Object**: Represents a specific quote for a distributor (1 Bid = 1 Tacton Quote).
  - **Relationship**: One Deal can have multiple Bid objects.
- **Benefit**: Keeps the Forecast/Pipeline clean (one Deal) while allowing multiple actual quotes (multiple Bids) to exist and sync with Tacton.

**⚠️ Forecasting Logic**

- **Challenge**: With multiple bids under one deal, which amount should populate the Deal Amount for forecasting?
- **Discussion**:
  - Could use the first bid, the average, or the lowest.
  - Using the sum would vastly over-inflate the pipeline.
- **Decision**: Logic will likely use the **lowest active quote/bid** to drive the Deal forecast amount.
  - "It's rare... but a lot of the time the lower one is the one that's gonna win."
  - Prevents tracking an artificially high potential revenue.
  - When a Bid is marked as "Won" (PO received), that amount becomes the definitive Deal Amount.

**Workflow Standardization**
**✅ Direct vs. Distributor Flow**

- **Question**: Should direct customer sales (no distributor) also use the Bid object?
- **Decision**: **Yes**.
  - All quotes should follow the same architecture to reduce process exceptions.
  - Even a single direct quote will create a Bid object.
  - "As much as we can keep that standardized... there are fewer exceptions to the process."

**Quote Management & Revisions**
**✅ Handling Re-quotes**

- **Scenario**: Customer requests a revised price or part change on an existing quote.
- **Process**: Do **not** create a new Bid object.
  - Tacton handles versioning (Quote v1 → v2).
  - The integration should update the *existing* Bid object with the new version info and amount.
  - A new Bid object is only for a *new* competing quote (e.g., a different distributor).

**⚠️ UX Improvement: Embedded Tacton**

- **Idea**: Embed the Tacton quoting interface directly inside HubSpot using a UI Extension (iframe) to prevent tab-switching.
- **Goal**: "Living in HubSpot" experience.
- **status**: Michelle to investigate feasibility.
  - **Constraint**: Need to check if Tacton security headers allow iframe embedding.
  - **Constraint**: Authentication (SSO) ensuring the user doesn't have to log in twice repeatedly.

**Data Integration & Source of Truth**
**✅ SAP & PO Integration**

- **Flow**: When a PO is received in SAP, it usually references the Quote ID.
- **Future State**:
  - Validated that we can link SAP Sales Orders back to HubSpot Bids/Deals using the Quote ID.
  - Ideally, SAP feeds back "Order Received" status/value to HubSpot.
- **Reporting Hierarchy**:
  - **SAP**: Definitive source of truth for Revenue/Orders.
  - **HubSpot**: Source of truth for Forecasting (before the PO).

**🚨 Commission/Financial Reporting**

- Confirmed that HubSpot is **not** the system of record for paying commissions or final financial reporting.
- This reduces the risk of minor data discrepancies in HubSpot (it allows for "leeway" as long as Forecasting is reasonably accurate).

---

**Next Steps**
**✅ Proof of Concept (POC)**

- Michelle to build a functional POC in HubSpot Sandbox to validate the "Distributor Bid" object model.
- Key goal: Demonstrate the workflow to the Taoglas team to ensure it doesn't add "20 steps" for sales reps.
- Validating automating the creation of the Bid object so it's seamless.
