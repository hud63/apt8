### **Role Context & Team Structure**

* Mark represents Taryn’s first external hire since joining A8 (Ashley came from internal retainer team)  
* Taryn’s new role: VP of Strategy & Enterprise (admits title sounds “ridiculous”)  
  * Michelle Kay becoming VP of Services Q1 to oversee core, retainer, enterprise teams  
  * Soraki remains Director of Delivery managing bench consultants  
* Current strategy team composition:  
  * Mark: Senior Strategy Consultant (new hire)  
  * Ashley: Strategy team member (1+ year tenure, significantly stepping up responsibilities)  
    * Recently closed two projects, having difficult client conversations, handling scoping  
    * Strong with ClickUp, time tracking, coordination systems  
  * Taryn: VP role managing overall strategy direction and methodology development  
* Enterprise team structure post-merger:  
  * Principal Consultants (PCs): Jen and Matt \- project leads and SMEs  
  * Bench Consultants: Managed by Soraki, allocated by PCs for specific tasks  
  * Project Managers: Noel (current) \+ Elias (starting Monday) \- coordination between PCs and bench  
  * Account Manager: Sam \- contracting, escalations, ELT meetings  
* Shared resources: Michelle Tabor (SE \- described as “unicorn”), development team under Reed

### **Strategy Service Offerings**

* Highest billable rate in company: $325/hour (vs $220 retainer, $235 standard engagement)  
* Three distinct SKUs with specific use cases:

#### **Feasibility Evaluation**

* Pre-HubSpot purchase assessment for complex custom systems  
* Real examples from this year:  
  1. AMS (Association Management System) migration  
     * Client wanted to migrate from NetFirm AMS to HubSpot  
     * Assessment: Technically possible but not recommended  
     * 27 different technologies in tech stack  
     * Member portal requirements, committee management, event systems  
     * Conclusion: Use lightweight AMS \+ HubSpot as central database instead  
  2. BCC Veterans Core Care Coordination  
     * Government funding coordination for veteran care services  
     * Heavy accounting/financial integration with government databases  
     * Recommendation: Optimize existing Salesforce instead of HubSpot migration  
     * Potential $2M revenue but would create poor client relationship  
* Philosophy: Genuine client benefit over sales \- “not HubSpot’s best friends” during evaluations

#### **Migration Roadmap**

* Post-purchase implementation planning for signed HubSpot clients  
* Scenarios: Rip-and-replace, total business process reevaluation, tech stack overhaul  
* Big project starting January as test case for PC involvement level

#### **Optimization Assessment**

* Existing HubSpot instances needing improvement  
* Common scenarios: Lost admin knowledge, 300+ workflows, 800+ email templates, 8 custom objects  
* CFOs inheriting complex systems without understanding  
* Evolution into RevOps consulting arrangements (ongoing consideration for strategic focus)

  3. **Discovery Interviews** \- Stakeholder requirements gathering (can involve 20+ interviews)

  6. **Refinement** \- Updates based on workshop feedback  
  7. **Strategy Review** \- Internal POC alignment before presentation  
  8. **Presentation** \- Varies from informal POC briefings to multi-tier presentations:  
     * Membership team: Task requirements and workload impact  
     * Executive leadership: Financial investment and resource allocation  
     * Board: ROI and customer experience improvements only
