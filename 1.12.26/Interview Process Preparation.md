Review all knowledge transfer materials from Sales. Watch any Avoma recordings provided to avoid asking clients to repeat information. Create an Interview Outline (template here) that includes:

A brief description of each interview topic. Internal team members required (Delivery Lead, Solutions Consultant, Solutions Engineer as needed).

Client participants, including primary POC, decision-makers, and team hierarchy.

The DL or PM shares the outline with the client in advance to assist in scheduling.

Use the User Stories document as the baseline to know what interviews need to occur but adjust as needed.

Here is an example of a filled out Interview Outline.

 Discovery Interviews

Prepare a set of role-specific, topic-specific deep dive questions for each planned interview.

Use AI (prompt below) to analyze the User Stories document against your interview topics and generate potential questions as a starting point. Do not rely on this to create your interview questions for you but rather use it as a jumping-off point. Tailor questions to participants and teams represented in each session. AI prompt:

If using Claude, create a project, upload all the sales call transcripts and the stories csv to the files section. Then in the chat you tell it what your planned interviews are and the attendees and tell it based on the files what should my goal and questions be for each interview \- This is a process where AI struggles so a lot of manual intervention is still needed to refine but it’s a good base.

        For any AI tool: Upload the Customer Stories CSV file and your interview outline file. Then paste in this prompt: 

I’ve uploaded two files:

* A CSV file of customer stories which includes information about various customers and their success stories.

* A document which outlines the planned discovery interviews, high-level topics, and a list of attendees for each session.

I want to prepare discovery interviews that deeply explore user requirements.

Please:

* Analyze both files to understand the context, goals, and participants for each planned session.

* For each interview session, generate:

\-- Clear goals and target outcomes for the session

\-- A detailed agenda (with time allocations and sequence of activities or discussion areas)

\-- Custom interview questions that connect the session’s focus areas to insights from the customer stories data (e.g., reference relevant industries, challenges, or success patterns)

\-- Discovery interview questions designed to uncover:

\--- What the user or customer needs (functional and emotional needs)

\--- What their current state looks like (data, tools, processes, challenges)

\--- What their future desired state or success vision is

\-- Include probing follow-ups that help uncover motivations, constraints, and success measures.

\-- Make the tone conversational, curious, and empathetic.

\-- Use a structure like this:

\--- Agenda

\--- Key Discovery Questions (grouped by need/current/future)

\--- Follow-Up Prompts

\--- Interviewer Notes (context from customer stories)

Output the results in a clear, structured format — ideally grouped by session name — so I can easily copy them into my interview guide or meeting notes.

Here is a work-in-progress document that the Solutions Architects use that you can also use to help as a jumping off point for some of your requirements analysis interview questions. At least two team members should attend every interview:

Delivery Lead Solutions Consultant

As needed: Solutions Engineer (required for integration/technical migration sessions)

Each session should:

Be fully recorded in Avoma (confirm settings before each call). Be Aptitude8-led, but with the client doing the majority of talking. Include flexibility to adjust questions based on real-time insights, meaning have a planned agenda but allow the conversation to flow organically and ask follow-up questions as opposed to just reading from the agenda like a script.

Feel conversational as opposed to a robotic question-answer, question-answer. You should be practicing active listening and asking follow-up questions based on what is said live on the call. 

First interview should also cover:

Client’s overarching business goals. How the client defines and measures success. The “why” behind the project – dig deep here to truly understand.

For example – the project is a Marketing hub implementation with a Salesforce Integration: Why do they want to integrate? To be able to have actionable data in Hubspot to market off of and get better attribution reporting. Why do they want that? Because today they don’t have any attribution reporting to know what marketing efforts are working and not working and their current segmentation options are limited without the Salesforce data. Why is that important? The marketing team has some Q4 KPIs they need to hit and can’t do that while “shooting in the dark”, and they can get much more targeted with better segmentation data. This will lead to more targeted outreach to existing customers and prospects, and therefore better client retention and more MQLs, thus allowing their team to hit their quarterly goals, thus contributing to the company’s overall revenue targets. Understanding all of the layers and levels in the why behind the project helps you make sure that all of our efforts and recommendations to them lend to the ultimate goal.
