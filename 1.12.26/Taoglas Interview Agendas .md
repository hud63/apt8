| :---- | ----- |
| **System Landscape & Data Flow (Today) HubSpot** Used inconsistently by different regions Deals represent long multi-year projects, not orders No closed-loop connection to SAP No reliable product, revenue, or production timing data No unified process for distribution vs. direct vs. PSCI No clear forecasting inputs **Tacton** Used only for quoting Pushes PDFs and quote numbers to HubSpot (minimal integration) Overwrites quotes when switching distributors → requires duplicate deals Custom part creation process is broken (takes 2+ weeks) **SAP** Source of truth for financials, orders, invoicing Completely disconnected from HubSpot Maintains multiple databases (Ireland → Taiwan) Requires extensive manual data entry and validation **There is no single system that creates an end-to-end view from lead → quote → PO → order → invoice → revenue. Sales Process (Across Regions & Divisions) Direct Sales** Deals stay open 3–5 years Multiple POs tied to one deal Sales struggles to update HubSpot while traveling No “expected PO” tracking No forecasting structure tied to production start dates Deal values inflated because project value ≠ actual revenue **EMEA Sales** Strongest HubSpot users Thousands of duplicate companies No parent/child structures No deal naming consistency across regions Quoting split between CS and sales **NASAC Sales** Overwhelmed by lead volume No prioritization framework Needs Tier 1/2/3 account model (company-level) No automated follow-up No Customer 360 (orders/invoices absent from HubSpot) **PSCI (Reseller)** Cannot forecast properly due to multi-tier sales flow Needs to assign reseller \+ distributor \+ end customer to one opportunity Complex part number creation workflow Requires 30/60/90 forecasting for channel **A\&D** Requires deal-level visibility restrictions ITAR-compliant workflow & routing Must add “Aerospace & Defense” industry classification **Distributor Channel Breakdown Key Pain Points** Distributor RFQs arrive entirely by email Multiple distributors competing → multiple deals per project Tacton cannot handle multi-distributor quoting No visibility into which distributor wins the business No consolidated project-level reporting Manual price calculations Outdated sync with Tacton Email-to-deal logging unreliable **Strategic Need** One **Project** that multiple **Distributor Deals** attach to Ability to track which distributor won Ability to eliminate inflated pipeline **CS & Order Management Operational Load Manual steps:** Quote creation Registration to Tacton Finding related quote for PO SAP order entry QC for every order Sending shipping docs Sending invoices Updating HubSpot with order numbers Email-based workflow for everything  **Institutional knowledge required:** Distributor shipping days Part number nuances Payment terms Production constraints Customer vs. end-customer PO differences **No documentation existsNo workflows existNo automation exists Marketing Operations Breakdown Lead scoring built but no conversion path** Sophisticated scoring system No SDR function to act on leads Sales doesn’t trust or work leads Leads circulate without ownership Webinar platform limited integration Thousands of lists/segments Workflows conflict Limited documentation from previous partner **Opportunities:** Create one SDR (Phase 1\) Define qualification → routing → follow-up Consolidate segments Audit workflows Integrate webinar platform Clean subscription types Align with future inside sales function **Finance & RevOps: Core Requirements Top priorities** Standard **Closed Won** definition Capture **production start dates** Capture **EAU by year** Create **Design Win date** Separate **project value** from **order/revenue** Build forecasting model showing revenue by year Align deal structure to SAP product structure Accurate pipeline reporting **Business impacts** Deals marked closed won but producing no revenue 2025 forecasts significantly inflated No ability to reconcile CRM to financial systems No accountability due to inconsistent usage **Cross-Team Themes (Root Causes)** Fragmented systems Nothing talks to each other. No standardization Each region/team evolved independently. Data model not aligned with business realityDeals represent multi-year projects—but system is built for one-off transactions. No forecasting foundation Production timing, units, and ramp schedules are missing everywhere. Manual operations everywhere CS \+ Disty \+ Sales \= hundreds of hours/week lost to copy/paste. Lack of HubSpot governance No definitions, no data rules, no required fields, no adoption oversight. |  |

| Summary  |  |
| **Call Overview Date:** 10/17/25**Participants:** Taryn Cleary (A8) Ashley Burgess (A8) Louise Sinnott (Taoglas) Lize-Mari du Plessis (Taoglas \- Customer Service/Order Management) **Current State Process Flow 1\. Lead/Inquiry Entry Points Web forms** (HubSpot forms) → Creates support tickets automatically **Website chat** (chatbot) **Direct emails** to customer service **Trade shows, referrals, distributors** Small inquiries handled by CS team; larger projects passed to sales **2\. Quote Request Process** Customer submits quote request via HubSpot form Ticket created in support pipeline within HubSpot CS team creates deal in HubSpot with company/contact information For distributor deals: May include both end customer and distributor information **3\. Quote Creation (Tacton CPQ)** Quote built in Tacton CPQ system Pricing and product configuration handled in Tacton Quote sent as PDF to customer **Key Issue:** Tacton only used for quoting \- no order management functionality **4\. Purchase Order Receipt & Processing Disconnection Point:** POs often arrive on completely separate email threads from quotes Buyer typically sends PO directly to orders team, not following original quote thread Manual verification required: Order team must search Tacton for matching quote to verify pricing Account name mismatches common (e.g., parent/subsidiary) **5\. Order Entry Process (Highly Manual)** The order entry person must: Search Tacton for the quote using part numbers Verify pricing matches the PO Open HubSpot deal for customer information Manually enter everything into SAP ERP system Copy-paste extensive information between systems: Purchase order reference Customer details End customer information Forecast data from HubSpot Shipping instructions Sales opportunity number (HubSpot Deal ID) Sales quote reference (Tacton quote number) Project names Manufacturer rep information (US orders) **6\. Quality Control & Approval** Separate QC person reviews every order due to high error risk Orders tracked in manual spreadsheet QC person checks: Information against original PO Correct salesperson association in HubSpot Unit pricing in Tacton Orders marked as either "Approved" or "Send PI" (Pro-forma Invoice for prepayment customers) **7\. Order Confirmation & Database Sync** Once approved, order marked as "Confirmed" in system Internal purchase order created (more manual steps) Order pushes from Ireland SAP database to Taiwan SAP database Taiwan team handles production planning Taiwan reference number generated **8\. Deal Closure in HubSpot** Sales order reference added to HubSpot deal Deal stage changed to "Closed Won" Multiple orders can be appended to same deal (bulk orders delivered incrementally) **9\. Invoicing Process** Taiwan team responsible for shipping Daily bulk email with invoice attachments sent from Taiwan CS team must manually: Find corresponding order for each invoice Email invoice to correct customer Match invoices to original order correspondence **Key Pain Points Identified System Disconnection** Three separate systems (HubSpot, Tacton, SAP) with no integration Extensive manual data entry between systems Quote and PO processes completely disconnected **Manual Process Burden** "It's brutal" \- excessive copy-paste operations Every data point manually transferred multiple times High risk of human error at numerous touchpoints Difficult to train new employees ("I couldn't imagine teaching this to someone") **Scalability Issues** Current process cannot scale with business growth Heavy dependency on individual knowledge Risk if key employees leave **Verification Challenges** Account name mismatches between systems Manual matching of POs to quotes Need for separate QC process due to error risk **Critical Observations Tacton Limitation:** Only serves as a quoting tool with no order management capability \- essentially just generates PDF quotes **Email Thread Discontinuity:** Quote approval and PO submission happen on separate email threads, breaking process visibility **Multiple Database Management:** Maintaining both Ireland and Taiwan SAP databases adds complexity **Invoice Distribution:** Completely manual process for matching and sending invoices to customers    |  |

| Summary  |  |
| **Call Overview Date:** 10/17/25**Participants:** Taryn Cleary (A8) Ashley Burgess (A8) Louise Sinnott (Taoglas) Amy Kavanagh (Taoglas \- Distribution Support) Pattie Redmond (Taoglas \- Distribution Support) **Current State Process Flow 1\. Inquiry Entry Points (Different from CS) 99.9% via email** \- distributors send registration forms directly No web forms for distributor inquiries (unlike Customer Service) Rare internal tickets from sales team for RFQs No automated ticket creation \- purely email-based workflow **2\. Registration/Quote Request Process Registration Creation** Distributor sends registration form via email (often their own format) Team manually creates deal in HubSpot as either: Quote request Distributor registration Manual data entry from various spreadsheet formats into HubSpot **Deal Setup Challenges** Must identify correct distributor branch location (parent-child structure exists but finding branches is difficult) EBV good at specifying branches; others like Future are not Amy uses personal territory map as desktop background to identify sales rep ownership Manual calculation of deal amount using distributor cost spreadsheets and calculator Deal validity set to 1 year (standard registration period) **3\. Registration Status Management** Initial status: "Pending" Email sent to distributor to confirm if registration or just pricing request Manual tracking of all communication via email Reliance on checking deal emails for updates (email logging issues common) **4\. Pricing & Quote Approval Process** Case-by-case pricing decisions requiring sales rep consultation Default: Quote 10% below book price for standard requests Registration pricing uses distributor market cost Sales reps may request further discounts All communication via email \- no systematic approval workflow **5\. Quote Creation in Tacton** Similar to CS process \- move deal to "Quote" stage triggers Tacton Sync between HubSpot and Tacton from March 2023, never reviewed New Tacton version launched this week but sync not updated **Critical System Limitation: Multiple Distributor Deals The Core Problem** When multiple distributors request quotes for the same project: **Cannot modify distributor in Tacton without overwriting all previous quotes** Example: If Arrow has a quote and EBV requests one, changing to EBV overwrites Arrow's quote **Current Workaround Must create separate deals for each distributor** requesting quotes on same project Results in 6-7+ duplicate deals for single project across different distributors Clone deals to reduce manual re-entry, but still must: Remove original distributor Add new distributor Maintain all separate deals **Visibility Issues** No consolidated view of all distributors bidding on same project Must click into each deal individually to check status Recent improvement: Adam added registration status indicators, but still limited Cannot easily identify which distributor won the business Orders team must "siphon through" deals to identify winning distributor **Pain Points Identified Process Inefficiencies Excessive manual data entry** from distributor spreadsheets Manual price calculations using external calculators No pricing stored in HubSpot line items (all zeros in system) Email-based workflow with high risk of missed communications Manual checking for duplicate registrations **System Limitations** Tacton overwriting issue forcing duplicate deals No consolidated project view across distributors Email logging failures to HubSpot Outdated HubSpot-Tacton sync (2+ years old) **Visibility & Reporting Gaps** Cannot see all distributor activity for single project No automated duplicate detection Difficult to track which distributor ultimately wins business Limited reporting on distributor performance **Scalability Concerns** Time-consuming deal duplication process Manual verification of all registrations Heavy reliance on individual knowledge (territory maps, pricing rules) **Team Suggestions for Improvement Distributor Portal Concept** The team's primary request: Create a self-service distributor portal where distributors can: Log in and submit registration/quote requests Auto-populate data into HubSpot System checks for existing registrations Flag duplicate projects automatically Reduce email dependency **Automation Opportunities** Automated duplicate detection and flagging Improved pricing communication workflow with sales team to reduce consultation delays Improved email-to-HubSpot integration Better branch identification system **System Improvements** Fix Tacton overwriting issue or find alternative CPQ Create unified project view showing all distributor activity Update HubSpot-Tacton sync with new Tacton version Store pricing data in HubSpot for reference **Order Processing** Once quote approved, PO typically goes directly to CS Orders team Distribution team forwards any POs received to Orders Orders team moves deal to "Closed Won" Same manual SAP entry process as Customer Service **Key Differences from Customer Service Entry point:** Email-only vs. web forms/tickets for CS **Deal complexity:** Multiple distributors per project requiring duplicate deals **Registration management:** Year-long validity periods with renewal process **Pricing decisions:** More variability requiring sales consultation **Impact Assessment Operational burden:** Hours spent on duplicate deal creation and management **Business risk:** Missed opportunities due to poor visibility of competing distributors **Revenue impact:** Difficulty tracking distributor performance and win rates **Strategic limitations:** Cannot effectively analyze distributor channel effectiveness   |  |

| Summary  |  |
| **Call Overview Date:** Discovery session for EMEA Direct Sales **Participants:** Taryn Cleary (A8) Ashley Burgess (A8) Louise Sinnott (Taoglas) Sam McCarthy (Taoglas \- EMEA Direct Sales, 10 years with company) **Current State of EMEA Sales Process HubSpot Usage & Adoption Two main activities:** Updating deals with notes and tracking emails **50/50 split in team:** Two of four EMEA team members create their own quotes in Tacton, two rely on CS **Mobile limitations:** Cannot use HubSpot app in landscape mode (frustrating for long deal names) Uses HubSpot "like an elaborate Excel table" with extensive filtering Filters for: EMEA deals, deals not touched for 60 days, deals past close date **Email Management & Activity Tracking** Often sends emails directly from HubSpot (especially for 60+ day old deals) Uses 2-3 click template: "Hi \[Name\], just wanted to reach out to see if there's been any movement on this project" **Critical practice:** Manually deselects all associations except the specific deal to keep data clean **Major concern:** If team members only track sent emails (not received), information becomes "useless" for coverage Balance needed between complete activity tracking and "activity fatigue" **Deal Management Structure** Considers deals as projects with long names (customer name \+ project name \+ part number) Creates clear visibility for finding information **Challenge:** US teams may not follow same naming conventions, making cross-regional support difficult **Major Pain Points Data Quality Issues Customer data chaos:** \~15 versions of same customer (e.g., Itron US, Itron Inc, Itron Japan) Identified 3,000+ duplicate company records during call No parent-child relationships established for related companies Domain analysis shows multiple companies with same domain but different names **Process Inconsistency** Deal value calculations vary by person, region, and channel (direct vs. distribution) No documented standards ("If I had a doc that I can pull up and show the standards, I would follow it") Different regions (US, APAC) have unknown processes Quote creation split 50/50 between sales and CS within EMEA team **Administrative Burden** Salespeople constantly pressured to "beat last year's numbers" with same time allocation Must "squeeze in more work" and "go quicker than last year" Admin tasks pile up during travel, customer dinners, exhibitions "Counting life in clicks" \- every additional step matters **Information Accessibility** Support teams struggle to find information quickly Risk of delays when salespeople are traveling/unavailable Inconsistent deal naming across regions creates confusion Email tracking inconsistency makes coverage difficult **Client Recommendations Process Unification Strong stance:** Direct and distributor sales processes should be aligned "Sales is sales. I couldn't care less if it's Disney sales, if it's direct sales" Keeping processes similar enables flexibility in CS/distribution support teams Prevents "I wasn't trained on the disty process" situations during coverage **Quote Creation Preference** When forced to choose 100% commitment either way: **Preference:** Customer Service should handle all quotes **Rationale:** Salespeople not always at PC, time constraints, increasing targets **Caveat:** Would accept sales-created quotes if automated ("if the salesperson could do the admin without actually doing the admin") **Information Architecture** Advocates for making information easier to find: Standardize deal naming conventions globally Improve filtering and search capabilities Ensure all relevant information visible in deal record Reduce time support teams spend "digging" for information **Cross-selling Opportunities** Identified automated cross-sell potential: Flexible antennas naturally pair with connectors "Either you want it or you don't" \- no complex technical requirements Could be first automated cross-selling implementation Later expand to marketing-driven cross-sell campaigns **Key Insights on Company Culture Historical Context** Team "traumatized by SAP" \- still affects current behavior Never had email tracking capabilities in SAP (finds HubSpot feature valuable) Muscle memory from old processes still influences current practices **Regional Differences** EMEA: Good data accuracy and relatively consistent usage US/APAC: Unknown processes and practices Company-wide data accuracy questionable outside EMEA **Opportunities for Improvement Immediate Wins** Document and communicate standard processes Establish global deal naming conventions Clean up duplicate company records (3,000+ identified) Create parent-child relationships for related companies **Process Standardization** Unify direct and distributor sales processes Define consistent deal value calculation methods Standardize quote creation responsibility (recommend CS ownership) Create coverage protocols for consistent information availability **Automation Potential** Auto-populate quotes from deal information in HubSpot Implement connector cross-sell for antenna purchases Reduce manual admin through workflow automation Create automated follow-up sequences for aging deals **Data Governance** Implement data cleaning initiative ("holy grail" per Sam) Establish ongoing data quality monitoring Create validation rules for new data entry Define ownership for data maintenance **Strategic Alignment** Sam's vision strongly aligns with A8's project goals: Process refinement and standardization Improved forecasting through better data Enhanced cross-functional collaboration Reduced manual burden through automation **Critical Success Factors Buy-in for unified processes:** Must overcome resistance to change **Data cleanup commitment:** Essential for accurate reporting **Documentation and training:** Clear standards needed for adoption **Balance automation with flexibility:** Maintain personal working styles while ensuring consistency  |  |

| **Call Overview****Attendees:** Taryn Cleary (A8) Ashley Burgess (A8) Louise Sinnott (Taoglas) Michael O'Regan (Taoglas \- Distribution Sales, recently expanded to Global Distribution) **Current State & Recent Changes Michael's Role Evolution Previous scope:** Europe and North America distribution **New scope (as of last week):** Global distribution including APAC **Primary focus:** Strategic initiatives, partner relationships, revenue/deal generation metrics **Reality:** Drowning in admin work to fix data problems **Distribution Channel Scale 4 sales reps in Europe 2-3 sales reps in North America** (uncertain after recent changes) **200+ distributor branches in Europe 500+ distributor sales engineers** Critical insight: "We don't have the bandwidth to bring in all the opportunities they can bring in" **Distribution Structure & Organization Major Distributors (Broadline) Arrow Electronics:** 62 branches in Europe, 41 in North America **Future Electronics:** Based in Canada, similar branch count **EBV:** Similar scale across regions **Avnet:** Comparable presence **TTI:** Fewer branches but still significant **Organizational Structure** Successfully implemented 18 months ago: Moved from single company entities to branch-level organization Created parent-child relationships (e.g., Arrow EMEA → 62 child branches) Separated by region (North America, APAC, Europe) \- no global parent Each deal now associated with specific branch, not parent company **Before & After Branch Implementation Before:** One Arrow entity with 500+ deals Impossible to filter or report by location No visibility into branch performance **After:** Can see deals by branch (e.g., 24 deals in Milan) Sales reps can view relevant contacts/deals before meetings Performance tracking at branch level Clear visibility: "This is what we're doing in Milan, Atlanta, Mexico, Calgary" **Major Pain Points Process Inconsistency Changed deal creation process 3-4 times in 12 months** Different regions follow different processes Example: North America doesn't enter declined registrations; Europe enters everything "Very difficult to pull any report that makes sense" **Data Quality Issues** Registration forms not imported correctly Contacts from forms often missing or incorrectly associated "Not entering stuff the way it needs to be entered" Deals created as "placeholders" with minimal information **Limited Engagement "Hundreds and hundreds of deals that nobody is touching"** Sales focuses only on top 10 high-value deals Small deals (e.g., $5k) ignored despite cumulative value Distribution support team lacks contact information to be proactive **Manual Burden** Michael doing extensive manual data cleanup Support team (Amy, Pattie, Sanjivini, Lestat) spending time on admin vs. strategic work Manual follow-ups for registration approvals Unable to automate due to poor data quality **Current Reporting & Metrics Key Performance Indicators** Deal generation volume (quarterly/monthly/weekly) Deal values by distributor and region Branch-level performance metrics Registration approval/decline rates Conversion rates and territory coverage **Reporting Challenges** Numbers "not very accurate" due to process changes Data gets "skewed" when combining regions "Too many reports" \- Michael constantly creating new ones Cannot provide reliable global numbers **Vision for Future State** **Standardization Goals** Unified process regardless of region "A quote request is a quote request" whether from Mexico, Italy, or China Same Tacton → HubSpot → quote process globally Clear ownership and accountability **Automation Opportunities** Registration approval workflows (request info → follow up → auto-decline) Task creation for time-based actions Automated responses for common scenarios Sequences for deal follow-ups **Strategic Focus Areas Data accuracy first:** "Getting data in the right places first is probably the first problem" **Reliable reporting second:** "Being able to report on it and stand by the data" **Forecasting/planning third:** "Can come out of that once you have data correct" **Team Dynamics & Challenges Sales vs. Distribution Support Tension** Sales feels distribution is "stepping on their toes" Michael to sales: "This $2.5k deal is irrelevant for you... go work on $100k+ deals" Need for more autonomy in distribution support team "We've pushed for more autonomy... looks like we're gonna get that" **Support Team Capabilities** Currently reactive: "Very much dealing with what's coming into them" Desire to be proactive but lacking time and system support Limited customer interaction (mostly email, rare phone calls) Need better tools to identify and pursue opportunities **Critical Insights** **On CRM Philosophy** "The CRM is to manage the actual customers by definition" Need branch-level visibility for true customer management Everything else (quotes, registrations, commissions) comes after data accuracy **On Automation Concerns** "Automation is as good as the data in the system" Risk of appearing inaccurate if CRM not updated Need SLAs before implementing automation Must fix data quality before automating processes **Unique Requirements Multi-Distributor Project Challenge** Current problem described: Multiple distributors competing for same project creates duplicate deals with inflated pipeline values Proposed solution concept: Associate multiple deals to single project Show only project value, not cumulative deal values Maintain visibility of all competing distributors Track which distributor ultimately wins **Recommendations Immediate Priorities Standardize processes globally** \- no regional variations **Fix data entry requirements** \- enforce at system level **Clean existing data** \- dedicate resources to cleanup **Establish clear ownership** for deals under certain thresholds **Process Improvements** Define single global process for registration handling Create automated workflows for common scenarios Implement branch-level reporting standards Establish SLAs for CRM updates **System Enhancements** Improve contact import from registration forms Create project-level view for multi-distributor opportunities Build dashboards for branch performance Enable proper parent-child relationship reporting **Cultural Changes** Enforce "if it's not in HubSpot, it doesn't exist" mentality Give distribution support more autonomy Clear delineation between sales and distribution ownership Regular data quality audits  |  |

| Summary  |  |
| **Call Overview Attendees:** Taryn Cleary (A8) Ashley Burgess (A8) Adam (Taoglas \- CRM Operations) Alan Cronin (Taoglas \- Head of Marketing)  **Current State of Marketing Operations Team Structure & Resources** 3-person marketing team  Supported by NXT agency for technical implementation Also working with Cadre (new partner for lead generation) Marketing concepts (MQL, SQL) were completely new 18-24 months ago "We've come an awful long way, but we're only probably still right at the start" **Marketing Technology Stack** HubSpot Marketing Hub (primary platform) ZoomInfo (prospect identification) GoToWebinar (not integrated with HubSpot) Clay (via Cadre for lead enrichment) Multiple external platforms for samples, events **"Demand to Deal" Framework Current Lead Generation Process** List Creation: CRM contacts or ZoomInfo prospects Campaign Execution: Primarily email (awareness & consideration phases) Lead Scoring: Complex model (nearly complete, \~90%) Qualification Email: Sent on behalf of salespeople Handoff Challenge: No one to receive and work leads **Lead Scoring System Two-Dimensional Scoring Model** The system combines numerical scores with letter grades to create a comprehensive qualification matrix: **Numerical Scoring Levels: Level 4:** Entry level (2,000+ points) **Level 3:** Moderate engagement **Level 2:** High engagement **Level 1:** Highest engagement **Intent/Company Grading (A-D): Grade D:** Unknown \- only activity data available **Grade C:** Target company match (from sales-provided lists) **Grade B:** Known job title within target company **Grade A:** C-suite executive within target company **Combined Score Examples: A1:** Perfect lead \- C-suite at target company with highest activity **C4:** Target company but low engagement **D1:** High activity but unknown company/role **Scoring Triggers:** Email opens Webinar registrations Sample orders (high score \- indicates buying intent) Content downloads (spec sheets, 3D files \- different weights) Form submissions Page visits **Activation Threshold:** Once reaching specific score combinations (e.g., A1, B1, C1), automated email sent on behalf of salesperson with option to book meeting slot **Major Pain Points Critical Gap: Sales Handoff** No SDR function to pre-qualify leads Sales team focuses only on target accounts "Low hanging fruit" and non-target accounts ignored Previous attempt failed: "Leads weren't acted on" Sales doesn't understand why something is a lead: "They downloaded a few data sheets. Oh, great. But that doesn't mean they're ready" **System Complexity** "Overly complicated" systems built previously "Messy and hard to figure out what is built and what it does" Workflows conflict with each other Too many segments and lists (mentioned "thousand segments") Currently stopping non-essential work to document everything Lack visibility into the build Agency implementation “hit or miss” **Sales Alignment Issues** Sales team "primarily focus on target accounts" Marketing leads often not target accounts No clear process for non-strategic opportunities Sales sees marketing leads as low quality Lack of buy-in from field sales **Technical Challenges** Multiple agency partners with different approaches No integration between webinar platform and HubSpot Unclear coordination with Cadre's lead generation efforts Limited visibility into what NXT agency is actually building **Vision for Future State Proposed SDR Model** Start with ONE person (could be regional, up to 3\) Filter all leads through this person Connect their email for personalized outreach Do manual prospecting on leads (company size, employees) Prove the model works first, then scale **Simplification Goals** Stop building complex systems Focus on "smaller bite-sized chunks and little wins" Clear handoff process between marketing and sales Better documentation of existing systems Consolidate agency efforts **Future Opportunities Identified** Web order nurturing: Currently do nothing with online orders POS data utilization: Know companies buying through distributors Deal stage nurturing: Marketing emails during long sales cycles Sample order follow-up: High-intent signals not being leveraged Cross-sell/upsell campaigns: Based on purchase history **Lifecycle Stages Evolution** Started with: Traditional lifecycle stages (too complex) Current state: Not actively used, replaced by scoring Alan's view: "The scoring is really what dictates the usefulness of a contact" Future potential: Background segmentation for customer types (evangelist, repeat buyer) **Key Requirements & Asks Technical Needs** Review existing workflows for conflicts Simplify overly complex segments and lists Evaluate custom properties and objects Integrate webinar platform with HubSpot Implement CTA/popup capabilities strategically **Strategic Needs** Fresh eyes on current implementation Future-proof the system for coming years Clear SDR/qualification process Better sales-marketing alignment Simplified, documented processes **Critical Success Factors For Immediate Progress** One dedicated person for lead qualification Prove the model with measurable success Simplify existing systems before adding new ones Document everything clearly **For Long-term Success** Sales buy-in through demonstrated value Clear handoff processes and SLAs Unified approach across agencies Focus on "control what we can control" |  |
| Lack of marketing \-\> sales handoff (SQLs)  HubSpot use: demand to deal \- series of activations to try to create/qualify leads for sales (lists, segments, zoominfo to identify \> HS \> email marketing, lead scoring model built and near 100% with intent score threshold \> email/sequence on behalf of sales rep) Discussing handoff with Taylor (sales focuses on target accounts, marketing looking at “everybody else,” low hanging fruit), looking for inside sales  Cadre looking at B2B \> Clay \> HS moving into LS model Look at distie orders to identify contacts and reach out for upsells (company match in zoominfo) GoToWebinar integrated with HS for registrations etc Email subscription types built out based on personas (aerospace and defence, generic technology, etc) opt in \> subscribe \> create segments Legacy data cleanup (people leaving companies, contacts out of date) Health dashboards for data hygiene Not wed to anything, want to set up for success and do it right, hoping what’s build is a usable foundation (but don’t have full visibility into what current partner is doing) Would love to funnel all leads to 1 BDR to qualify **Lead Score Triggers** Sample product ordered Download datasheets 1-4 ABCD \- C \= target company, B \= job title, A \= c-suite Combined score (A1 would be top) No marketing taking place in funnel; no scores/emails for existing customers CW/CL \- not being used for marketing purposes Lifecycle stages implemented prior to Lead Scoring. No longer in use for marketing, focusing on the score Focusing on awareness and consideration  **Areas for improvement:** Making sure emails are set up correctly (mentioned spf, dmarc \- is there a domain issue?) NXT \- current hands-on agency partner (results have been hit or miss), working on getting them to document everything they’re building Capabilities not accessing Build fit for future scaling? Marketing best practice recommendations Review segments for optimization (active and static) Audit workflow conflicts (flagged by Adam) \- Alan is compiling active workflows Audit custom properties (e.g. contact source) GA integration (not currently integrated) Marketing email comes from no reply (awareness), when sent on behalf of salesperson, it’s still coming from the no reply address (not all sales inboxes are connected) Emails delivered but contacts no longer with the company \- manual cleanup to remove, mark non-marketing The Process and The Reality are different |  |

| **Call Overview****Attendees:**  Taylor Kimmerle (CRO/NA Sales Lead) Noel Mythen (RSM \- North America) Ashley Burgess (A8) Taryn Cleary (A8) **Current State Process Flow Lead Entry & Triage** 20,000 website visitors per month generating leads Marketing sends leads but historically not worked by sales team No clear prioritization framework for which deals sales should pursue \- currently going off of dollar amount only Outside sales team overwhelmed with volume while traveling 2-3 weeks/month **Deal Creation & Management** Sales creates deals in Hubspot during discovery/qualification Deal stays open throughout entire sales cycle Multiple POs can be associated with single deal over 3-5 year timeframe Deal shows total project value (e.g., $1M) but actual sales happen incrementally (e.g., $10K at a time) **Quote Process** Sales team requests quote from CS team Quote generated in Tacton PDF sent to customer **Disconnection Point:** Sales doesn't always know when PO is received by CS **Deal Closure** Sales manually marks deal "Closed Won" in Hubspot when PO received **Key Issue:** Deal marked "won" but actual order may not be in SAP yet No automated validation between Hubspot closure and SAP order creation Creates inflated pipeline and forecasting inaccuracies **Post-Close Management (Current Gap)** Once deal marked "Closed Won" in Hubspot, nothing else happens in CRM No tracking of repeat orders from same customer No visibility into order patterns or next expected PO Sales manually tracks when to "go get" next PO from customer **Key Pain Points Identified System Usage While Traveling The Challenge:** Outside sales (Directors, RSMs) travel 2-3 weeks per month Difficult to update deals on the road Need mobile access to customer information before meetings Calendar constantly changing due to flight delays, travel disruptions **Current Workaround:** Sales team doesn't consistently update Hubspot while traveling Manual calendar management (sending available times vs. calendar links) Can't easily access full customer history on mobile **Impact:** Deal data becomes stale Lost opportunities due to lack of follow-up Sales going into meetings without full customer context **Deal Prioritization & Volume Management The Problem:** No framework for which deals to prioritize Sales team trying to handle everything from $2K deals to $250K+ accounts Marketing generating leads but sales can't work them all Inside sales doesn't exist yet to handle lower-tier opportunities **Planned Solution (2026):** Implementing 3-tiered account model across all regions: **Tier 1:** $250K+ annual value → Director \+ RSM **Tier 2:** $10K-$250K annual value → RSM **Tier 3:** Under $10K annual value → Inside sales **Critical Requirement:** Tiering must be at **company level**, not individual deal level One company could have 4 projects at $8K each \= $32K total \= Tier 2, not Tier 3 Need aggregate view of all deals per company to determine tier **Follow-Up Gaps Noel's Key Pain Point:** "There's definitely some \[deals\] that fall through through the cracks that aren't followed up on... having that follow up piece, having that automated in some capacity will be massively beneficial and time saving as well as being beneficial from actually getting and winning deals." **Current State:** Manual follow-up only Deals go stale while sales team travels No automated reminders or sequences Sales juggling too many accounts to maintain consistent cadence Not sustainable/scalable **Desired State:** Automated sequences based on deal stages Triggered follow-ups when deals go stagnant Reduced need for manual calendar management **Deal Value vs. Actual Revenue The Problem:** Deal created for $1M total project value Customer orders incrementally: $10K now, $10K in 6 months, etc. Hubspot shows $1M in pipeline ("we're millionaires\!") But only $10K actually sold and invoiced **Impact on Forecasting:** Pipeline appears inflated Can't differentiate between projected value and recognized revenue Finance can't accurately forecast based on Hubspot data No way to track what's been ordered vs. what's still projected **What's Needed:** Separate fields for "total project value" vs. "closed revenue" Track incremental POs against larger deal Integration with SAP to show actual invoiced amounts **Post-Close Deal Management Gap Noel's Vision:** "If we can implement something on the Hubspot side with regards to existing deals, like a go get PO list... here's a list of POs that I would typically anticipate this month. Let's go chase down the customer to get those POs in hand." **Current State:** Deal marked "Closed Won" \= end of Hubspot activity Sales manually tracks repeat order patterns No visibility into when next PO expected Have to remember "Customer X orders 40K pieces every 6 months" **Desired State:** Track order patterns in Hubspot after initial close Proactive notifications: "Customer X due for reorder" "Go get PO" workflow to chase expected repeat business Continue managing customer relationship in CRM post-close **Customer 360 View Missing Noel's Top Request:** "Having the ability to leverage Hubspot to have all of the information for that particular account... over the last two to 3 years, we've sold $2,000,000 worth of stuff to them... when I'm on the road and I'm about to go into that customer, I have all of the information there. I can pull it up on the phone and everything is there." **What's Missing:** Historical sales to account Open orders/POs Invoice status Past product purchases Order patterns and trends **Current Reality:** Information scattered across Hubspot, Tacton, SAP Can't pull comprehensive customer view on mobile before meeting Risk of going into customer meeting uninformed ("I was just gonna pitch you on ordering something" when they just ordered) **Requires:** SAP ↔ Hubspot integration to show orders and invoices Mobile-optimized customer view Historical transaction data visible in CRM **Inside Sales Expansion (2026 Initiative) Current State:** Only NASAC region has inside sales Outside sales can't handle lead volume Marketing leads not being worked **2026 Plan:** Roll out inside sales across all 3 regions (NASAC, EMEA, APAC) Inside sales handles Tier 3 accounts \+ lead qualification Outside sales focuses on Tier 1 & 2 strategic accounts **Hubspot Requirements:** Lead scoring and routing automation Clear lifecycle stages showing handoff points Meeting scheduler for inside sales (less critical for field team) Defined process: Marketing → Inside Sales → Outside Sales **Alignment with Marketing:** Alan building lead scoring model Need clear handoff process when inside sales launches Calendar links more practical for inside sales than traveling reps **Critical Observations Calendar Management Complexity Meeting Link Concerns for Field Team:** "The biggest challenge would be... flight times and travel times... wouldn't necessarily always be blocked out on the calendar, so the fear would be that someone books a meeting and no one shows up." \- Noel Travel changes constantly (delays, cancellations) Can't always update calendar in real-time More control needed over scheduling **But:** Calendar links valuable for inside sales team **Long-Term Deal Structure Taylor:** "It is not like for like—you have a deal and you get one PO and that deal is closed. You also have that deal, and that deal is open for 3, 5 years with multiple POs onto that deal." Deals don't close after single transaction Ongoing relationship management required Need deal structure that accommodates long sales cycles Multiple POs appended to same deal over time **ERP Integration Reality Check Taryn:** "When you're integrating an ERP with anything, it's never not a light conversation. It's definitely a little bit of an undertaking. But... we have to match the timeline and lift versus value it's gonna have." SAP integration is complex but necessary Team understands it's not quick or easy Value justifies the effort Part of broader digital transformation strategy **Priority Requirements for NASAC Sales Team Tiered account model** \- Company-level classification with aggregate deal value visibility **Automated follow-up sequences** \- Deal stage-based automation to prevent deals falling through cracks **Post-close deal management** \- Track repeat order patterns and "go get PO" workflows **Mobile customer 360 view** \- Complete account history accessible on phone for pre-meeting prep **SAP integration** \- Show orders, invoices, and historical transactions in Hubspot **Deal value structure** \- Separate total project value from actual closed/invoiced revenue **Lead routing framework** \- Prepare for 2026 inside sales expansion with scoring and assignment **Deal prioritization tools** \- Help sales focus on highest-value opportunities **Alignment with Other Teams Marketing (Alan):** Lead scoring and inside sales handoff aligns with demand generation initiatives **Finance/RevOps (Nakita/Eileen):** Deal value vs. actual revenue critical for accurate forecasting; SAP integration needed for reporting **CS/Order Management (Lize):** Both teams need SAP integration; CS also needs visibility into when deals marked "won" **Distribution Team:** Tiered account model may apply differently but concept is universal **EMEA/APAC Sales:** Tiered model and inside sales expansion rolling out to all regions in 2026 |  |
| Standardize implementation based on North American operations, then push to other regions **NASAC Process:**Using HS for sales opportunity entry \+ mgmtCustomers enter (partners, website, referrals, etc)Create deal \[Customer\]\_\[Project Name\]\_\[Product Number\]Add notes/updates90%+ deals created by sales repsCS creates quotes, majority send quote to sales rep to send to customerPO received to orders inbox \= CW, order mgmt team handoff Deals stay open for years, multiple POs received Large accounts to be entered/managed by directors, with less reliance on CS (moving to inside sales) 75% of deals come from distie side We can get deals/initial info in, struggle with moving through the pipeline in HS (difficult to update on the road) Implementing inside sales support for all regions in 26 Understand who owns each stage/account based on tier threshold (company-level spend in tech sector \- compiled project accounts) Email Tracking Issue: tagging to the correct deal \- emails being tagged to multiple deals and seeing irrelevant emails on deal records  Would like all emails, calls, meetings, notes flowing into HS correctly, automatically Previous vendor fell short on documentation, level of difficulty (overcomplicating), training Currently no sequences or automation in place (rely on sellers to stay on top of deals) \- quote follow up, samples follow up,  Leverage HS to manage CW deals for recurring orders (“go get po process”) No scheduling tools in place, doing it old school Want to leverage HS for followup, all account info (e.g. 2-3 years sold $2m, open orders, closing the loop with SAP)  |  |

| Summary |  |
| **Call Overview****Attendees:** Taryn Cleary (A8) Ashley Burgess (A8) Adam (Taoglas \- CRM Operations) Chris Friend (Taoglas \- PSCI Sales Leader) Norfel Hebron (Taoglas \- PSCI Sales) **PSCI Business Model Channel-Only Sales Structure** 100% channel sales \- "We sell nothing direct" Multi-tier distribution: Tier 1: Taoglas → Distributor Tier 2: Distributor → Reseller Tier 3: Reseller → Customer Sometimes additional tier: Integrator/Upfitter **Partner Ecosystem** \~115 resellers currently active 3 master distributors: Get Wireless (primary partner \- highest discount) TD SYNNEX Ingram Micro Partners at Get Wireless conference: resellers, OEMs, carriers **Market Segments** Despite "Public Safety & Critical Infrastructure" name: Public sector (police forces, city agencies) Oil and gas Healthcare Retail "You name it" \- resellers specialize in different verticals **Unique Business Challenges Complex Forecasting Requirements The Core Problem:** "We have to forecast by reseller, which also will go through a distributor. But you can't forecast it for the distributor if you forecast it for the reseller" Example Deal Flow: Reseller (BCDR) brings deal for 1,200 antennas Purchase will be made by Get Wireless (distributor) Get Wireless sells to BCDR BCDR sells to city agency **Challenge:** Where does the forecast number land in HubSpot? **Tagging & Attribution** Need to tag multiple entities per deal Track reseller who brought the opportunity Track distributor who will purchase Track end customer (when known) Maintain visibility across 30/60/90-day pipeline **Pricing Model Differences M\&I uses MSRP-down model:** Fixed MSRP with tiered discounts Resellers quote themselves No internal quoting process **vs. OEM team uses cost-up model:** Calculate cost plus markup Internal team creates quotes **Product Complexity Part Number Proliferation** Example: Synergy Series Antenna 75 different part numbers for one product line Variables can include: 11-in-1 down to 4-in-1 configurations 3 color options Multiple cable types Various connectors **Part Number Creation  Previous manual process:** Email request → few days initially → progressively improved through optimization **Current "automated" process:** Up to 2 weeks (automation attempt made it worse) **Business impact:** "My team is not allowed to quote a lead time of over two weeks... we can't take two weeks just to get a part number" **Partner Tier Structure Discount Levels Gold:** Entry level **Platinum:** Mid-tier **Elite:** Higher tier **Custom:** Strategic partnerships (45%+ discounts possible) **Strategic Discount Management** All additional discounts come from Get Wireless's margin "No skin off our back" to increase reseller discounts Example: New partner given 45% discount speculatively Review after 90-120 days, adjust if targets not met **Team Structure & Evolution Current State** Chris and Tim handle larger/strategic accounts Team members manage mix of all tier levels Shared account management based on relationships **Future Vision** "When we grow up and be who we wanna be": Chris and Tim have no direct accounts Team manages all reseller relationships Leaders focus on strategy only Exception: Legacy relationships (e.g., Tim with Comcast) **Key Requirements for CRM Ease of Use** Mobile app critical \- team travels constantly Must be "easy and quick to enter opportunities" Real-time entry "as soon as it comes in" **Forecasting Capabilities** 30/60/90-day pipeline views Multi-entity tracking per deal Clear attribution across distribution tiers Avoid double-counting in forecasts **Comparison to Other Systems** Salesforce: "Super easy for sales... front end system" Other CRMs: "Great backend systems, but front end not so good" HubSpot potential: "I'm sure it can be \[great\], we just gotta figure out" **Pain Points Identified System Issues Part number creation delays** \- attempted automation made process worse (was days, now 2+ weeks) **Forecasting complexity** \- can't properly track multi-tier deals **Mobile limitations** \- difficult to use on the road **Attribution challenges** \- unclear where to assign revenue **Process Breakdowns** Part number creation taking 2+ weeks after failed automation attempt No visibility into true pipeline across partners Cannot properly track partner performance Difficult to manage strategic discount programs **Business Impact** Lost opportunities due to part number delays Inaccurate forecasting Reduced field productivity Strategic partner management challenges **Opportunities for Improvement Immediate Needs** Fix part number creation process (return to \<3 day turnaround) Implement proper multi-tier deal tracking Improve mobile experience for field sales Create clear forecasting rules for channel sales **Strategic Enhancements** Partner portal for self-service Automated discount management Performance tracking by partner tier Integration with distribution systems **Process Optimization** Standardize partner onboarding Automate tier reviews (90-day evaluations) Streamline multi-entity tagging Clear attribution rules for forecasting **Cultural Insights Team Dynamics** Collaborative approach to account management Flexibility in strategic partnerships Focus on relationship building at events Pragmatic about system limitations **Business Philosophy** "We work with people who sell our product" Strategic use of margin to grow partnerships Long-term relationship focus (Tim with Comcast example) Willingness to take risks on new partners  |  |
| **Chris and Tim in Puerto Rico for reseller conference** OEM (previous interviews) is very different process Day to day prospecting: Team works with carriers, resellers, OEM manufacturers, distributors, NO DIRECT SALES, could be 3-4 layers between PSCI team and end customer Oil and gas, healthcare, retail, resellers all specialize in different areas All-in with HubSpot if it can manage what we need it to manage  **Day to day:** evangelize, educate, train on Taoglas name and brand, support resellers (115), 3 master distributors  Currently HubSpot “not great” for their model \- has to be EASY for sellers on the road all the time Has to forecast by reseller and distributor but only able to do one in HS (tag reseller) Need 30, 60, 90 funnel visibility A lot in HS/Tacton etc is broken (Norfel dealing with the bulk of this) Reseller Deal Stages: Lead/Initial Opp, Qualified (reached out, verified opp), Quoted (by the reseller), In Negotiation, Closed Norfel share price list Other side of the house is Cost Up This side is MSRP Down 1 antenna line could have 75 part numbers \- common to have to add more parts/connectors (need to create these on the fly for new combinations of parts) Tried to automate the process but it’s not really working and could take 2 weeks to get PART NUMBER created (for the reseller to quote it) Inventory mgmt issue (if we’re avg 1k/quarter, we should have that much stocked) Coordinate with operations team \- goal to eliminate manual processes How are you remembering and following up on these conversations throughout this sales process? Varies by person on the team, multiple avenues (deal tracker spreadsheet, reseller spreadsheet to track reseller status) Would love for everything to be handled in HubSpot \- 75 to 100 balls in the air every day Ease of entering data \- it’s harder to do than people think or make it out to be  Gaps and pain points: daily task to flag any part number being sent out to attempt building it in Tacton (Product Management team to get involved, create outside of Tacton, enter into SAP) because that particular part variant isn’t available Very relationship based They do have reseller Tiers (determines pricing), everyone handles all partners, Tim and Chris only handling largest partners \- ideally they won’t have accounts “when they grow up” Gold, Platinum, Elite, Distie, Custom |  |

| Summary |  |
| **Call Summary Date:** October 31, 2025**Attendees:** Kevin Blakeley (Head of Aerospace & Defense, Taoglas) Jeremy DeLorenzo (Inside Sales/Operations for A\&D, Taoglas) Ashley Burgess (Aptitude 8\) Taryn Cleary (Aptitude 8\) **Key Business Context Division Overview Launch:** January 2024 (new/emerging division) **Geography:** North America focused, but has some international A\&D customers (Canada, Australia contractors) **Split:** Division handles both Aerospace (e.g., Amazon Air Prime drone delivery) and Defense (e.g., Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics) **Team Size:** Small \- primarily Kevin and Jeremy, plus select US citizen CS reps and engineers (Carlos, Patrick) **Customer Base Defense customers require stricter security** than general aerospace Examples: Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Brink Non-defense aerospace: Amazon Air Prime, other commercial aviation Geographic spread: US-based primarily, but work with Canadian customers and international contractors **ITAR Security Requirements The "CAN" Framework** Acronym to explain security needs: **C \- Clearance:** Who is working on ITAR-sensitive projects (currently only Kevin, Jeremy, select US citizen CS reps and engineers) **A \- Access:** Who can see the opportunities in HubSpot **N \- Need to Know:** Information sharing is limited to only those who need it **Current Authorized Users** Kevin Blakeley (Head of A\&D) Jeremy DeLorenzo (Inside Sales/Ops for A\&D) Dermot O'Shea (CEO \- became a US citizen) COO (US citizen) Select customer service reps (US citizens only) Engineers: Carlos and Patrick (US citizens only) **Note:** Kevin described wanting an "aerospace amoeba" \- a tight group that all have clearance, access, and need-to-know initially, with the ability to remove people on a deal-by-deal basis as customer requirements dictate. **Future State** As projects mature, customer requirements may restrict visibility further Example: "Lockheed Martin said only Kevin and Carlos can see this deal" \- need ability to lock down to deal level May need to push even C-suite executives out of certain deals based on customer restrictions **What Needs to Be Protected Most Critical:** Drawings and technical files attached to deals Product specifications Sensitive project details **Less Critical but Still Restricted:** Contact and company records (shared across Taoglas, but activities/deals should be restricted) Deal/opportunity information Activity/communication logs **Key Concern:** Engineers (like Carlos) are very concerned about ITAR compliance and want assurance that "only US citizens have worked on this" to avoid legal issues. **Critical HubSpot Requirements Priority 1: Access Control & Security HARD REQUIREMENT:** Create a separate, secured silo for A\&D opportunities with restricted access **Approach:** Set up a dedicated HubSpot team for Aerospace & Defense Kevin and Jeremy as team owners Collaborator-based access model (similar to how distributor reps only see deals they're added to) Default: No access to A\&D deals unless explicitly added as collaborator Must restrict even other Taoglas employees from viewing these deals **Critical Note:** Because we’re not security experts, the current plan is to: Build base security framework in HubSpot Have Taoglas validate with their ITAR consultant Adjust based on consultant feedback **Priority 2: Industry Property Update HARD REQUIREMENT:** Change industry dropdown to include "Aerospace and Defense" as its own category **Current State:** Industry dropdown includes: Telematics, Telehealth, Public Sector, etc. No specific A\&D option (currently combined with Public Safety) This is THE identifier that determines if a deal needs security restrictions **Future State:** Add "Aerospace and Defense" as distinct industry option This property drives access control and reporting **Current Workflows & Processes Lead Routing Current Process:** Customer service receives website lead via email CS determines if it's A\&D based on: Company name/industry research Geographic location (some regions \= higher A\&D likelihood) Product inquiry type If A\&D, CS forwards to Kevin/Jeremy If company already in HubSpot, owner assignment helps with routing If new company not in HubSpot yet, routing can be manual/circular across teams **Challenge:** A\&D leads aren’t always immediately recognizable, so they may circulate before landing with Kevin/Jeremy **Opportunity Management Current State:** Kevin tracks opportunities mentally: "I'm working on 2 projects with General Dynamics, 1 with Amazon" Can generate reports from HubSpot showing active opportunities by account No standardized A\&D pipeline or reporting structure yet **Desired State:** Dedicated A\&D reports showing: Active opportunities by customer Revenue by account Pipeline visibility (secured/restricted) **Technology & Tools Current Tech Stack HubSpot:** Primary CRM **Copilot (Microsoft):** Jeremy uses for AI-assisted data entry and lead qualification **Quadra:** AI company training team on Copilot optimization **AI/Copilot Usage (Jeremy's Process)** Jeremy has built custom Copilot prompts to: Enter company name Copilot researches company and returns HubSpot-formatted data Includes logic for assigning to Kevin for A\&D companies Prompt includes criteria like "anything that flies commercial" \= assign to Kevin Has improved efficiency in lead qualification and data entry **Wish List Item:** Better integration or automation of this AI-assisted lead research and routing **Wish List Items (Beyond Core Requirements) 1\. AI-Enhanced Lead Intelligence** Automate what Jeremy is doing with Copilot When CS receives lead, system automatically: Researches company Populates HubSpot fields Assigns to correct rep based on industry/geography Flags if A\&D related **2\. Better Lead Assignment Logic** Automatic routing based on industry detection Clear flagging for A\&D opportunities Prevent leads from circulating unnecessarily **3\. Reporting & Visibility** Dedicated A\&D dashboard Pipeline reports (within secured environment) Account-level opportunity tracking Revenue analytics by customer **Open Questions & Considerations Gray Areas to Define Shared Records:** Contacts and companies are shared across Taoglas teams, but deals must be isolated \- how to handle the associations? **Activity Logging:** Can non-A\&D team members see activities logged on shared contacts? **Granular Security:** Which fields/data points require highest security vs. which can be more open? **International A\&D:** How to handle non-US A\&D customers (Canada, Australia contractors)? **Deal-Level Restrictions:** Mechanism for locking down specific deals to subset of A\&D team, as needed **Next Steps** Kevin and Jeremy will continue to identify specific use cases Send additional requirements/scenarios via email as they arise A8 to build base security framework Taoglas to validate with ITAR consultant Workshop sessions once discovery is complete |  |

| Summary  |  |
| **Attendees:** Nakita McCarthy (VP Finance/RevOps), Eileen O'Reilly (Group Financial Controller), Taylor Kimmerle (Head of Sales), Louise Sinnott (CRM Head), Ashley Burgess & Taryn Cleary (Aptitude 8\) **Primary Focus Areas: Forecasting Accuracy** \- Critical business priority requiring standardized closed-won definitions **Revenue Recognition Timing** \- Understanding when deals convert to actual revenue in SAP **Pipeline Reporting & Predictability** \- Need visibility into production start dates and deal timing **Data Standardization** \- Establishing minimum required fields and consistent definitions across teams **System Adoption & Accountability** \- Identifying HubSpot champions and enforcement mechanisms **Key Insight:** Finance/RevOps can only forecast and report accurately when sales teams consistently use standardized definitions, particularly for "closed won" status and production timing data. **CRITICAL PAIN POINTS 1\. Forecasting Challenges Current State Issues:** EMEA deals marked "closed won" in HubSpot but revenue never materialized in 2025 Cannot distinguish between design wins vs. production start dates No visibility into when customers will actually begin production (might be 2027 even if deal closed in 2025\) Constant overestimation because production ramps up much slower than anticipated No data to track or automate pipeline timing **Business Impact:** "We've been burned badly by the level of deals marked closed won in EMEA in particular... the vast majority of what was marked as closed won in HubSpot would have valued has not come in this year, and what we don't know is, is it gonna come in next year? Was it actually not closed won?" \- Nakita McCarthy **What's Needed:** Production start date tracking by year Design win date vs. production date separation EAU (Expected Annual Units) by year to understand ramp schedules Ability to exclude deals from current year forecasts if production won't start until future years Historical tracking to hold sales teams accountable **2\. Revenue Recognition & SAP Integration Key Question:** When does a "closed won" deal in HubSpot actually translate to revenue in SAP? **Current Workflow:** Deal marked closed won in HubSpot PO received → manually entered into SAP Order fulfilled → revenue recognized in SAP **Gap:** Time lag between HubSpot "closed won" and actual SAP revenue recognition **Finance Needs:** Clear definition of when deals should be marked closed won Understanding of the HubSpot → SAP order flow Ability to track expected revenue timing vs. actual Reconciliation between pipeline forecasts and actual booked revenue **Integration Priority:** HubSpot deal data needs to map cleanly to SAP for revenue tracking Product-level data structure must align with how SAP organizes revenue Need to capture sufficient detail at deal creation to enable accurate SAP mapping later **3\. Product & Deal Structure Alignment Challenge:** HubSpot deal structure doesn't align with how finance tracks revenue **Eileen's Concern:** Finance doesn't track individual deals \- they track products and revenue streams Revenue reporting happens at product line level, not deal level Need to ensure deal data can be aggregated meaningfully for financial reporting **Nakita's Point:** "Whatever way it's gonna be in SAP is what way it needs to go into Hubspot... We need to be able to capture the information at the deal and product level... We need to break it down into a way that we can then map it through to SAP." **Requirements:** Deal structure in HubSpot must enable product-level revenue roll-ups Product categorization needs to match finance reporting categories Custom products and new designs need clear pathway from HubSpot to SAP Standardized product data entry at deal creation **4\. Closed Won Definition Crisis The Problem:** No standardized definition of "closed won" across teams, leading to: Inaccurate pipeline reporting Failed forecasts Lost trust in CRM data Inability to hold teams accountable **Nakita's Priority:** "The number one thing that we have to standardize is when something is marked as closed won, and we have to make sure that it is not marked as closed won by anybody other than the definition that we are all in agreement on and signed off on because that is that's the one that's gonna trip us up." **Discussion Points:** Is closed won \= PO received? Is closed won \= production confirmed? Is closed won \= first order shipped? Different teams may have different interpretations currently **Action Needed:** Document current team-by-team definitions Establish single, company-wide closed won definition Build system controls to enforce definition Train all teams on new standard **REPORTING & METRICS REQUIREMENTS Revenue & Forecasting Metrics What Finance Needs to See: Pipeline by Production Start Year** Deals expected to start production in 2026, 2027, 2028 Ability to exclude future-year production from current year forecasts **Design Win vs. Production Tracking** When did we win the design? (design win date) When will production start? (production start date) What's the expected production ramp schedule? **Revenue Recognition Timing** Closed won date Expected first order date Actual first order date Gap analysis **Product-Level Performance** Revenue by product line Win rates by product category Custom product vs. standard product mix New product adoption rates **Pipeline Health Metrics** Age of deals in each stage Conversion rates by stage Average time in each stage Closed won accuracy (predicted vs. actual revenue) **Operational Metrics What RevOps Needs:** CRM adoption rates by user/team Data quality scores (% complete required fields) Time to update deals after status changes Manual process identification (where are bottlenecks?) Quote-to-close conversion rates Lost deal analysis with reasons **Accountability Metrics:** "How do we hold them accountable to what we're seeing today? Because we've got things marked as closed won... we need to know who to push on and who not to." **STANDARDIZATION REQUIREMENTS Infrastructure Standardization Must-Haves: Pipeline Stages** \- Same stages across all teams (with channel-specific variations documented) **Required Fields** \- Minimum data set needed for forecasting: Deal value Close date Expected production start date Product information Customer production timeline **Closed Won Definition** \- Universal, enforced definition **Product Structure** \- Consistent product categorization aligned with SAP **Process Standardization Ashley's Framework:** "I really view standardization through a couple of different lenses. Right? So we have the actual infrastructure standardization... But then also, like, you have the human standardization aspect. Like, we're all using the system in the same way." **Required Alignments:** When to create deals When to progress deals through stages When to mark deals closed won How to enter product information How to update deal timing/production dates **Definition Alignment Critical Definitions Needed:** Closed Won Deal Value (is it annual? Lifetime? First year only?) Production Start Date Design Win Date Expected Annual Units (EAU) Lost Deal vs. Pushed Deal **DATA QUALITY & SYSTEM ADOPTION Current Adoption Challenges What's Working:** Some teams (like Sam in EMEA) use HubSpot consistently Web forms and ticket creation functioning well Basic deal tracking in place **What's Not Working:** Inconsistent data entry across teams Sales teams don't see value in CRM data entry System feels "broken" due to inaccurate forecasts Manual processes create perception that HubSpot is extra work **Root Cause:** "When you are working a system that's not working for you, it's hard to understand how what feels like busy work is actually moving you further ahead... right now, like, your CRM feels broken, and so I don't blame people for feeling like they're not seeing the benefit of using it." \- Ashley Burgess **HubSpot Champion Requirement Critical Success Factor:** Need internal HubSpot champion **Champion Role:** Cheerleader and accountability partner Bridge between IT/technical and sales end users Regular check-ins with teams on data quality Reinforcement of "why" behind process requirements Escalation point for issues **Discussion: Taylor:** Hard to get someone from sales team (not their focus) **Eileen:** Needs to be someone between technical and sales \- RevOps role **Louise:** Should it be technical side or sales team member? **Ashley's Guidance:** "When I see it only kind of coming from, like, an IT or technical side, it sometimes doesn't resonate in the same way with that end user" **Ideal Profile:** RevOps or Business Partnering role Understands both system and sales reality Has credibility with sales teams Can see reporting/analytics and identify issues Empowered to hold teams accountable **IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS Phased Approach Discussion Question:** What's the minimum viable standardization? **Nakita's Perspective:** "What is the minimum things that we need to standardize?... What data at a minimum do we need in order to serve all the different purposes that we're talking about?" **Recommendation: Phase 1 \- Critical Standards:** Closed won definition Required fields for forecasting Production timing capture Product structure alignment **Phase 2 \- Process Optimization:** Sales enablement features Automated workflows Advanced reporting Integration enhancements **Change Management Strategy Key Considerations:** Training on new standards and definitions Clear communication of "why" behind changes Early wins to demonstrate value Regular feedback loops Enforcement mechanisms (system controls where possible) Recognition for good adoption **Accountability Mechanisms:** Dashboard showing data quality by user Regular team reviews of pipeline accuracy Manager involvement in holding teams accountable System validations to prevent incomplete submissions **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS Executive Alignment** \- Nakita, Eileen, Taylor, Louise driving standards **Clear Definitions** \- Especially "closed won" and production timing **Minimum Viable Data** \- Focus on essential fields first **HubSpot Champion** \- Internal advocate for adoption **System Enforcement** \- Controls to prevent bad data entry **Value Demonstration** \- Show sales teams how good data helps them **Regular Review Cadence** \- Ongoing monitoring and adjustment **Bottom Line:** Finance/RevOps cannot forecast or report accurately without sales team adoption of standardized processes and definitions. The \#1 priority is establishing and enforcing a universal "closed won" definition, followed by capturing production timing data to enable accurate revenue forecasting.   |  |

# ✅ Followup: CS/Order Management Interview

| Goals |  |
| :---- | ----- |
| Move beyond understanding "what happens today" to exploring "how can we optimize this in HubSpot" Focus on practical improvement opportunities rather than just documenting current state Identify manual processes that can be automated or streamlined (e.g. data entry and copy/paste activities across systems) Understand where CS/Order Management interfaces with multiple systems (HubSpot, SAP, Tacton) Map out where data breaks down or requires manual intervention |  |

| **[A8 // Taoglas Discovery \- CS/Order Management](https://app.avoma.com/meetings/26f3938b-7f5f-4e74-b120-3861bcbf25a2)** |  |
| Summary  |  |
| **Core Responsibilities of Customer Service (CS) & Order Management Customer Service (Presales \+ Inbound Support)** Handles presales inquiries: web forms, general email inbox, direct customer questions Creates and manages quotes, pro forma invoices, and compliance documents Performs deal creation and contact data entry within HubSpot (top-of-funnel) **Order Management (Post-Sales Fulfillment)** Uses HubSpot deal information to support SAP order entry Manually loads all orders into SAP Performs the required QC process before orders are fully processed (separate team member reviews another’s work) **CS time is heavily consumed by:** Quote creation Order entry into SAP QC reviews Responding to email volume (approx. 200 emails/day for Irish team and \~350/day for US) **Quote, Order & Invoice Flow (Current State) Quote Creation** Quotes created in Tacton (CPQ) Tacton only generates PDF quotes (no order management capabilities) Quote PDFs sent manually via email HubSpot used for deal creation and storing quote numbers, but no deeper process integration **Purchase Order Receipt** POs typically arrive on unrelated email threads, separate from the quote Orders team must manually search Tacton to match each PO to the correct quote PO references vary: customer PO reference and internal sales order number Occasional mismatches—parent vs subsidiary names, payment terms changes, etc. Significant institutional knowledge required (e.g., known shipping days per distributor) **Manual Order Entry into SAP** Order entry person must manually transfer information from: The PO email → The Tacton quote → The HubSpot deal → Into SAP **Data manually copied includes:** Part numbers Pricing Customer \+ end-customer details Shipping instructions Internal sales order reference Manufacturer rep information (US) Forecast and deal information from HubSpot Credit terms (must be manually updated in both SAP and HubSpot) **QC Process** Second CS team member reviews each manually loaded order Shared spreadsheet used to track all orders needing QC QC checks for: Correct pricing vs Tacton Correct sales owner Correct PO reference Alignment with HubSpot deal High risk of discrepancies → QC required for every order **Order Confirmation, Fulfillment & Invoicing** After QC approval, order is confirmed in SAP Order moves between Ireland SAP and Taiwan SAP (in our examples) Taiwan team handles production and shipping Daily email sent from Taiwan with \~200 PDFs (invoices, packing lists, COCs) CS team manually extracts documents, identifies customer, and sends individually No automated linkage between shipment documents and existing customer email threads **Key Challenges Identified System Disconnects** HubSpot ↔ SAP not integrated (not attempted yet; remains on long-term roadmap) Limited Tacton → HubSpot integration in place today (quote PDFs \+ quote numbers), but no functional integration Order data exists only in SAP; HubSpot is used for presales **Heavy Manual Burden** Large volume of copy/paste across multiple systems Quote threads never linked to PO threads Shipping confirmations require \~1 hour/day for 3–4 CS team members CS receives approx. 200 emails/day for Irish team and \~350/day for US; inbox management is a major bottleneck **Institutional Knowledge** Examples: Distributor-specific weekly shipping days Production constraints (e.g., cannot ship certain items from Vietnam) Internal vs customer PO reference logic None of this is systemized or documented **Scalability Concerns** High dependency on individual CS reps Process complexity makes onboarding difficult Current volume is not sustainable with manual workflows **Automation & Future State Streams  Cadre Automation Stream \#1 — EDT (Estimated Delivery Time) Change Notifications** High-level future process includes: Pulling real-time changes from SAP (all 4 global databases) and Power BI Change detection engine flags reschedules, delays, and EDT updates Rules engine evaluates SLAs and customer requirements Messaging engine routes: Internal alerts when EDT falls outside acceptable ranges Customer notifications when changes are within expected parameters Future HubSpot tie-in: update shipping status or ticket records (TBD) **Client note:**HubSpot currently not used for post-order communication; all order-related emails occur in Outlook. **Cadre Automation Stream \#2 — Shipping Document Distribution** Intended to automate the daily bulk shipping email: **Future Workflow:** Listener detects inbound “daily traffic” email OCR extracts: PO number Internal sales order Customer identifier Invoice & shipping documentation SAP queried for any missing contextual data System identifies correct customer \+ matches to email thread Auto-sends shipping documents to correct customer using templates Human-in-the-loop only for edge cases **Important clarification from CS:**This flow should be strictly for shipment notifications only, not EDT notifications. **Cadre Automation Stream \#3 — Manual Order Entry Automation** Targeting the most painful part of CS’s workflow. **Future Workflow:** OCR used to extract PO data (from email or upload) Tacton queried for quote \+ part validations HubSpot queried for: Sales owner Deal details Contact \+ company info SAP order fields automatically populated Notifications trigger for CS/logistics Requires reliable Tacton \+ SAP API integrations **CS Feedback:**Both HubSpot and Tacton must be part of the integration, since each provides unique required information. **Inbox Management Stream** Cadre proposing the use of Fin.ai \+ Rapid Flare Enables AI-driven: Email triage Auto-responses Routing Knowledge-based answers (incl. technical queries) Estimated email volume meets the required threshold (\~6,000/month) Cadre intends to perform bulk testing once email sampling is provided **HubSpot Future State Vision ** A8 is solutioning a future HubSpot architecture to balance forecasting, deal management, and multi-order visibility. **Current Issues:** Deals remain open for years because multiple orders tie to a single project Pipeline becomes inaccurate CS logs order numbers in deals but no structured order object exists Sales team lacks SAP access and relies heavily on CS for updates **Proposed Solution: Project-Based Architecture** Introduce a Project custom object Project remains open as long as the Project is active Individual orders become Deals associated to the Project Enables: Accurate pipeline forecasting Deal amounts tied to actual orders Expected vs received order comparisons Tracking of expected next PO date Visibility for sales team without needing SAP access **Additional HubSpot Future State Needs:** Ability to flag when expected POs are overdue Ability to roll up order amounts, shipped amounts, and invoiced amounts into Projects Potential for SAP → HubSpot sync of invoice numbers \+ revenue data **Strategic Visibility & Reporting Needs** Track expected PO schedules per distributor or customer Alert sales/CS when PO is late Long-term desire to store order documents centrally (HubSpot or another system) Provide full lifecycle visibility without giving sales access to SAP Preserve SAP as financial source of truth, but expand HubSpot as the operational source of forecasting and deal tracking |  |

# ❌ Engineering \+ Ops Interview

| Goals |  |
| :---- | ----- |
| **Understand Current Touchpoints** \- Map where Engineering and Operations intersect with the sales process today, even if those touchpoints are currently outside HubSpot **Identify Communication Gaps** \- Uncover where information breaks down between Sales → Engineering/Ops → back to Sales **Assess CRM Value Proposition** \- Determine if visibility into CRM data would actually help these teams vs. adding unnecessary complexity **Uncover Hidden Dependencies** \- Identify process dependencies that could impact CRM implementation (approval workflows, technical constraints, system limitations) **Resource Planning Insights** \- Understand if pipeline visibility would improve capacity planning for custom builds and order fulfillment **Quick Win Identification** \- Find immediate process improvements that could demonstrate value early |  |
| Agenda  |  |
|  |  |
| Questions  |  |
| **Current State Workflow Custom Design/NPI Process** Walk us through your typical interaction with a custom design or NPI project from initial request to completion At what points do you currently interact with HubSpot, if at all? How does the sales team currently communicate technical requirements to you? (Email, Teams, verbally?) Are these communications tracked anywhere systematically? **Tacton Approval Workflow** Baja receives approval emails directly from Tacton for custom parts \- can you walk us through this workflow? How do you track custom build requests that fall outside standard Tacton configurations? What happens when a custom request requires engineering review before quoting? **Pain Points & Information Gaps Process Delays** What causes delays in the quote-to-order process from your perspective? (e.g. incomplete specifications, back-and-forth clarifications, waiting for customer technical data, unclear priority/urgency, missing regulatory requirements) What information do you wish you had earlier in the sales process? (e.g. customer application details, operating environment, performance requirements, timeline expectations, budget constraints, competitor products they're evaluating) How often do you receive incomplete or unclear specifications from sales? **Future State Opportunities Ideal Workflow & Data Needs** If you could design the perfect handoff process between sales and engineering, what would it look like? What data points from the CRM would be most valuable for your team to access? (e.g. deal stage/probability to prioritize engineering resources, quoted delivery dates to plan production capacity, customer industry/application to anticipate technical requirements, deal size/volume to forecast material procurement, sales rep notes about customer technical discussions, competitor products mentioned, regulatory certifications required) Would visibility into deal status/pipeline help your resource planning? **Documentation & Specifications** How are technical specifications currently documented and shared? Do you maintain records of previous products/projects? Would a centralized location for project specifications be beneficial?  **Operations \- Procurement / Logistics Current State Workflow Order Management Process** Walk us through your process when a sales order comes in from SAP At what point does Operations get involved in the sales cycle? How do you currently track order status and communicate updates to sales? **Inventory & Availability** How do you communicate product availability and lead times to the sales team today? What happens when requested quantities aren't feasible? What communication method works best? What doesn't work? (Email, Teams, phone, etc.) **Systems & Data** Besides SAP, what other systems do you use daily? What data do you need from the sales side to do your job effectively? Are there gaps in information you receive when orders come through? **Pain Points & Manual Processes Process Challenges** What are your most time-consuming manual processes? Where do errors most commonly occur in the order management process? What causes delays between quote acceptance and order fulfillment? (e.g. missing purchase orders, pricing discrepancies between quote and PO, unclear delivery requirements, changes to specifications after quoting, customer credit holds, missing technical drawings) **Information Gaps** What information do you wish you had earlier in the sales process? (e.g. accurate volume forecasts, delivery date expectations, special packaging requirements, end customer identity) When you need information from sales about an order, how do you get it? How do you notify sales of issues (stockouts, delays, pricing discrepancies)? **Future State Opportunities Automation & Integration** What repetitive tasks would you most like to see automated? Would it be valuable to see deal/quote information from HubSpot in your workflow? What data from SAP should flow back to the CRM? (Order status, shipping updates, etc.) If sales could see real-time inventory/lead time data, would that reduce back-and-forth?  **Cross-Functional Questions (Both Teams) Resource Planning & Visibility Pipeline & Capacity Planning** Would visibility into the sales pipeline help you plan resources/capacity? What early warning signals from the sales process would be most valuable? How much lead time do you ideally need for custom projects or large orders? **Metrics & Reporting Performance Tracking** What sales support metrics do you currently track? What reports would help you better manage your team's workload? Are there KPIs tied to the sales process that affect your team? **Change Management & Adoption Past Experience & Openness** Have you been involved in previous CRM or process changes? What worked well or poorly? Do you have documented SOPs for your interaction with the sales process? What would make you and your team more likely to adopt new processes/tools? **Quick Wins Immediate Impact** If we could fix one thing in the next 30 days, what would make the biggest difference for your team? Are there any "low-hanging fruit" process improvements you'd recommend?  **Closing Questions Final Thoughts** What haven't we asked about that we should know? Any other pain points or opportunities you'd like to share? |  |

# ❌ High Service Distribution Sales Interview

| Goal  |  |
| :---- | ----- |
| Understand the high service distribution model and how it differs from broad distribution Identify why this team has limited HubSpot involvement currently Explore the "project tracker" use case mentioned in discovery  Understand relationship dynamics with end customers and contract manufacturers Determine what visibility/reporting would be valuable for this team  |  |
| Agenda  |  |
|  |  |
| Questions  |  |
| **Understanding the High Service Distribution Model Basic Model Education** First, help us understand: high service vs broad distribution vs M\&I Walk us through a typical customer relationship in your channel. How does it work from start to finish? What types of products or solutions do you handle vs. broad distribution? What types of customers do you work with? (Industries, company sizes, use cases) If you view your sales as “projects” rather than “deals” or “opportunities,” what does Closed Won look like? Are you moving the project through stages? Are there ever Closed Lost projects? **The Price List Model** Your customers typically "buy off price list directly" rather than requiring custom quotes. Can you explain this process? How is pricing determined/communicated? When DO you need to generate custom quotes? What percentage of your deals require Tacton quotes vs. standard pricing? If customers are buying off price lists, how do you track opportunities before they become orders? What's your role in the sale if pricing is already established? **End Customer Relationships** Do you ever work directly with end customers, or do you only work with distributors? How is your model different from the Broad Distribution team? Walk us through an example: If Boeing needs a custom antenna solution, what's the path? Do they come directly to you? Do they go through a distributor? Do they work with a contract manufacturer? Does Taoglas act as a contract manufacturer for any customers? When do end customers "graduate" from your channel to direct sales? Or does that not happen in high service? **Current Process & Tools Daily Workflow** What does a typical day/week look like for you? What tools and systems do you use most frequently? Where do you track active projects? Where do you track customer communications? How do you monitor project status? Where does most of your customer communication happen? (Email? Teams? Phone? In-person?) **Current HubSpot Usage** How DO you use HubSpot today? Why hasn't HubSpot been valuable for your team so far? The questionnaire mentioned "they don't see the benefit" \- can you elaborate? What would need to change to make it worth using? Do you track opportunities/projects anywhere else? (Spreadsheets? SharePoint? Email folders?) When customer service needs to create an order, how do they know about it? What info do you provide them? What does that handoff process look like? Or do you handle orders from end to end? Currently, is there any connection/integration between your project information and SAP orders? Talking future-state, what information would you want to flow from HubSpot to SAP? **Information Flow** How do you currently share information with: Customer service/order management team? Direct sales team (if there's crossover)? Engineering/product management? Finance for forecasting? What information about your projects/customers lives only in your head or email? When someone asks "what's the status of the Boeing project?" where do you look? **The "Project Tracker" Vision  Ideal State** You mentioned wanting to use HubSpot as a "project tracker." Paint that picture for us. What would you track? What stages or milestones matter? What would you want to see at a glance? What information would be valuable to you about each project? Technical requirements/specifications? Timeline/delivery dates? Key stakeholders/contacts? Custom vs. standard products? NPI (New Product Introduction) involvement? How is tracking a "project" different from tracking a "deal" or "opportunity"? **Reporting & Visibility Needs** If HubSpot worked perfectly for you, what questions would you want it to answer? What projects are at risk? What's my revenue forecast for the quarter? Which customers have multiple active projects? What's in engineering vs. what's in production? Who else needs visibility into your projects? (Leadership? Engineering? Finance?) What reports or dashboards would actually be useful? **End Customer & Account Structure Company/Contact Architecture** When you work with an end customer like Tesla: Do you interact directly with Tesla, or through their contract manufacturer? Who is the "company" record in your mind \- Tesla or the contract manufacturer? If Sanmina (contract manufacturer) places orders for 6 different customers, how do you track that? Do you need to track the relationship between end customers and their contract manufacturers? How do you currently maintain this information? **Customer Lifecycle** How do customers typically come to you? (Inbound? Referrals? Trade shows? Engineering relationships?) Do customers ever transition from your channel to direct sales? How does that work? Do you need to track customer history across different channels/buying patterns? When a project ends, does the customer relationship continue? How do you track ongoing relationships vs. one-off projects? **Cadre AI & Future Tools  AI Integration** Have you discussed any AI tools with the Cadre team? What parts of your workflow would benefit most from automation or AI? Project status updates? Customer communication? Engineering coordination? Are there repetitive tasks that waste your time? **Closing Questions** What's the biggest pain point in your current workflow that we haven't discussed? If you could fix ONE thing about how you track and manage customer projects, what would it be? Is there anything we should know about how your team operates that wouldn't be obvious to outsiders?  |  |
