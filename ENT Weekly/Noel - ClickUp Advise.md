### **ClickUp Scheduling & Protocol**

- Mark requested best practices for biweekly reports and calls
    
- Scheduling coordination needs to be worked out between Mark and Ashley
    
    - Not something the advisor can guide on specifically
        
    - Strategy team workflow details aren’t fully known by advisor
        

### **Enterprise Workload View Setup**

- Advisor shared link to enterprise workload view under A18
    
- Key setup actions:
    
    - Add view to favorites for easy access
        
    - Review on Fridays to check team capacity (red zones)
        
    - Ensure tasks have estimates (bottom right corner numbers)
        
    - Add descriptions so team knows what to do
        
- View will populate more as Mark gets assigned additional work beyond current Abundance 360 tasks
    

### **Personal Task Management Board**

- Created “Mark Seas board” - Kanban view grouped by due date
    
- Shows weekly layout: today, tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
    
- Setup steps:
    
    1. Group by due date instead of status
        
    2. Enable subtasks as separate tasks
        
    3. Enable auto-save
        
- Identified tasks with no due dates that need scheduling
    
- Allows direct task access for time tracking and status updates
    

### **Capacity Management Limitations**

- ClickUp workload view has known issues
    
    - Doesn’t split estimated hours between multiple assignees
        
    - Shows full task hours even if only partial work required
        
    - Not fully representative of actual capacity
        
- Workaround: Map ClickUp tasks to Google Calendar
    
    - Create work time blocks for specific tasks
        
    - Protect calendar from excessive meeting bookings
        
    - Use for end-of-day time tracking and task updates
        

### **Next Steps**

- Mark meeting with Ashley tomorrow to discuss project split responsibilities
    
- Mark can Slack follow-up questions (advisor aims to respond within one business day)
    
- Set up work time blocks in Google Calendar to protect working hours
