### ![📝](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f4dd/32.png) Notes

#### Current Workflow

- Weekly operational reviews track Q4 utilization (73.3%, 8,000+ hours) and run structured review cycles with peer and leadership approvals retroactive from December 1, due by December 19.

#### Inefficiencies Observed

- Delivery teams reaching 90% completion on custom code (CCAs) before involving the tech team creates handoff delays; flagging in Clickup is proposed to streamline review.

#### Key Stakeholders

- Michelle Koplowitz leads meeting updates, Reed Iandolo oversees tech and integrations, Robert Guinn details client evolution, Amber Larson is the new Director of Delivery, and Taryn Cleary manages enterprise org structure.

#### Tools / Systems Used

- Systems include HubSpot CRM, Rocketlane (with Salesforce integration), Clickup for flagging development tasks, Guru for holiday and review cycle tracking, Elfster for Secret Santa, and AI tools for code generation.

#### Root Causes Identified

- Complex client environments (e.g., Calibri lacking data hubs) and evolving enterprise demands increase project complexity, while inconsistent AI code generation signals the need for standard templates.

#### Proposed Improvements

- Proposals include flagging delivery-led development work in Clickup for tech review, developing a CLI tool for consistent AI-generated code, merging teams with clear DL roles and growth paths, and rolling out a prorated bonus structure for holiday months.

#### Impact

- Deal sizes are evolving from ~$25-30K to ~$56-65K with forecasts up to $1M; high red team utilization (81%) and projects (e.g., 700+ hour innovative project) boost client confidence and operational performance.

#### Metrics

- Key metrics include Q4 utilization at 73.3%, over 8,000 hours tracked, red team effective utilization at 81%, evolving deal sizes from ~$25-30K to ~$56-65K (with future mid-million engagements), and a holiday bonus threshold of 120 hours versus 160 normally.

#### Risk

- Risks include handoff delays from incomplete code reviews requiring additional tech involvement, potential resource gaps from multiple open positions, and rapid scaling challenges straining integration and delivery methodologies.

#### Future Hiring Projections

- Multiple open roles across teams: solutions consultant, enterprise PC, enterprise PM, PC principal consultant, PM project manager, two core consultants, and a core project manager.
- New hires include Mark See, Chris, and Elias, with a referral bonus program promoted.

#### Transition Planning

- Danae moved from red team to teal team.
- Amber promoted to recurring director of delivery after 6 months of foundation building.
- Red and Foxtrot teams merge effective January 1, creating open delivery lead opportunities.
- Mark Boyts to transition into core director role with support from Michelle during December-January.

#### Staff Development Strategies

- Staff are encouraged to notify their managers to join growth plans as deal sizes increase.
- Evolving processes and methodologies are being implemented to prepare staff for larger enterprise engagements.

#### Integration with Rocketlane

- Integration efforts with Salesforce and hours tracking are being developed by Martin, Reed, and Rebecca.
- Rocketlane pricing negotiations are underway with an early Q1 enterprise rollout planned.

#### Enterprise Engagement Structure

- Dev and SE resources remain under Reid's management for integration and support.
- New enterprise org structure: Saraki manages PMs and bench consultants while Taryn leads strategy, PCs, and AMs.
- Unified engagement process with a shared strategy phase and distinct roles for scope refinement by PCs.

#### Performance Recognition

- Matt Scary Monster was commended for innovative project work with custom architecture and budget adherence.
- Team shout-outs extended to Ashley, Maddie, and the Red team for outstanding execution and 81% utilization.
- John Jonathan Lopez was recognized for the highest number of high fives and widespread support.
