# Company Research Compiler

## Overview

This skill helps job seekers research companies thoroughly before interviews by compiling information from multiple sources into a single, well-organized docx report that covers company basics, recent news, culture, and interview preparation insights.

## Initial Clarifying Questions

Before starting research, introduce the questions naturally:

"Before I start, a few questions will help me tailor this:"

**Questions (both optional):**
1. What position are you applying for?
2. What's most important to you in your next role?

If the user provides answers, use them to tailor:
- Which interview questions to emphasize
- Which cultural aspects to focus on
- Which company news/projects to highlight
- The tone and depth of different sections

If the user doesn't provide answers or says "just research the company," proceed with a general report.

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Company Basics
Search for fundamental information:
- Company size (employee count)
- Industry and sector
- Headquarters location
- Year founded
- Public or private status
- If public: recent stock performance

Search query examples:
- "[Company name] employee count headquarters"
- "[Company name] company profile"

### Step 2: Recent News and Developments
Focus on the last 3-6 months:
- Major announcements
- Product launches
- Acquisitions or partnerships
- Leadership changes
- Funding rounds (for startups)
- Expansion or contraction

Search query examples:
- "[Company name] news 2025"
- "[Company name] recent announcements"

### Step 3: Culture and Employee Sentiment
Gather perspectives from current and former employees:
- Glassdoor reviews and ratings
- Employee testimonials
- Work-life balance feedback
- Management style
- Company values in practice
- Benefits and perks

Search query examples:
- "[Company name] Glassdoor reviews"
- "[Company name] employee reviews culture"
- "[Company name] working at"

### Step 4: Interview Intelligence
Find interview-specific information:
- Common interview questions
- Interview process details (rounds, timeline)
- What interviewers look for
- Technical assessment info (if applicable)
- Behavioral questions asked

Search query examples:
- "[Company name] interview questions"
- "[Company name] interview process"
- "[Company name] [role] interview experience"

### Step 5: Strategic Context
Understand the bigger picture:
- Main competitors
- Market position
- Recent challenges
- Growth areas
- Industry trends affecting them

Search query examples:
- "[Company name] competitors"
- "[Company name] market position"

### Step 6: Brand Visual Identity
Research the company's visual brand for document styling:
- Brand colors (primary color for headings)
- Logo (for header/top of document)
- Brand fonts (if available)

Search query examples:
- "[Company name] brand guidelines"
- "[Company name] logo"
- "[Company name] brand colors"

If you cannot find brand information:
- Use a professional, engaging font like Calibri, Georgia, or Verdana
- Use a professional blue (#2B579A) for headings
- Skip the logo

## Document Structure

Create a docx file with the following sections. CRITICAL: Keep total length under 3 pages.

### 0. Fit score (if user provided preferences)
If the user answered what matters to them, include a fit assessment at the very top in a centered box:
- Place immediately under the company name title and position subtitle
- Format as a centered paragraph with a border around it
- Content: "Fit score: X/10" on first line, then 2-3 sentence rationale
- Keep it factual and direct
- The box should be visually distinct but subtle
- Skip this entire section if user didn't provide preferences

### 1. What stands out (top of document)
- 3-5 unique, attention-grabbing points that matter most to job seekers
- Focus on what makes this company different or particularly interesting
- Could include: unusual perks, impressive growth metrics, notable recent wins, unique culture aspects, exciting projects, competitive advantages
- Make these punchy and specific
- Use this to hook the reader immediately

### 2. Culture and what it's like to work here
- Overall employee sentiment (mention Glassdoor rating if found)
- Work environment description
- Values in practice (not just what they say, but what employees report)
- Work-life balance feedback
- Benefits and perks mentioned
- Any red flags or concerns from reviews
- Day-to-day reality from employee perspectives
- Tailor this section based on what the user said is important to them

### 3. Company basics
- Keep this brief - just the essentials
- Industry, size, founded, headquarters
- Public/private status
- Main products or services in one sentence
- Current financial situation if relevant (growing, stable, struggling)

### 4. Recent company news
- List 4-6 most relevant recent developments
- ORDER FROM MOST RECENT TO LEAST RECENT (newest first)
- Focus on the last 3-6 months
- Include dates
- Focus on what matters for someone joining: new products, leadership changes, expansions, pivots
- Explain why each matters to a potential employee

### 5. Interview preparation
- Interview process overview (number of rounds, typical timeline)
- Common interview questions (5-8 examples)
- What interviewers look for
- Tips from people who've interviewed there
- Technical assessment details (if applicable)
- Anything unique about their process
- Tailor question examples to the specific role they're applying for

### 6. How to stand out in your interview
- 3-5 specific things to mention or ask about
- Recent projects or initiatives to reference
- Company challenges you could help solve
- ALWAYS include a section: "Questions that show you've done your homework" with 3-5 specific, thoughtful questions they can ask
- Ways to connect your background to their current needs

## Formatting Guidelines

**Brand-based styling:**
- Research and use the company's brand color for all Heading 1 elements (main section titles)
- If you find the company logo, include it at the top of the document (small, tasteful size)
- Use the company's brand font if you can find it in their brand guidelines
- If you cannot find brand colors/fonts, use engaging defaults:
  - Font: Calibri, Georgia, or Verdana (pick one that feels appropriate for the company)
  - Heading color: Professional blue (#2B579A)

**Document formatting:**
- Use sentence case for all headings (e.g., "What stands out" not "What Stands Out")
- Use Heading 1 for main section titles (use brand color)
- Use Heading 2 for subsections within main sections (use dark gray like #404040)
- Spacing: Use one blank line (double space) between sections - no more
- Fit score box: Center the fit score in a bordered box directly under the title and subtitle
- Add visual interest with:
  - Use of horizontal lines or spacing to separate major sections
  - Callout boxes or shaded backgrounds for important warnings or key insights
  - Icons or bullets that aren't just standard dots (→ or ▸ for example)
- Use bullet points for lists but vary the style
- Bold key phrases, numbers, and dates strategically (not everything)
- Use italics sparingly for emphasis or employee quotes
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)

**Content guidelines:**
- CRITICAL: Keep total length under 3 pages maximum
- Be direct and factual - no flowery language or unnecessary enthusiasm
- Avoid phrases like "that's serious money", "let's talk numbers", "that's not luck", or other narration
- State facts clearly without editorial commentary
- Be specific with dates and numbers
- Include both positive and critical information
- Focus on actionable insights
- Make it scannable
- Write in a direct, professional tone (not corporate-speak, but not overly casual either)
- Use actual employee quotes when relevant (in italics)
- Frame information around "what this means for you as a candidate"
- Be concise - prioritize quality over quantity
- Never use em dashes (—) in the report - use commas, periods, or parentheses instead

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing the document:
- Is it under 3 pages? If not, cut less critical details
- Did you include a fit score if the user provided preferences?
- Is the tone direct and factual without flowery language or narration?
- Are there any em dashes (—) that need to be replaced?
- Are sources recent (prioritize 2024-2025)?
- Is there a mix of official and employee perspectives?
- Are there specific examples and not just generic statements?
- Is the interview prep section actionable and tailored to their role?
- Would this actually help someone prepare for an interview?
- Is anything outdated or irrelevant?
- Are the "Questions that show you've done your homework" specific and thoughtful?
- Is recent company news ordered from most recent to least recent?
- Did you tailor the report based on what the user said matters to them?
