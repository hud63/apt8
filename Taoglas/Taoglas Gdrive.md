### 2. Demand to Deal and Lead Scoring Documentation - v1.0 (Document)

- **Date:** Nov 3
    
- This file provides documentation on the existing lead scoring model and the logic for lead qualification and nurture.
    
- **Scoring Framework:** The model aims to qualify leads by measuring engagement across three behavioral dimensions: Website Activity (general browsing, low score), Technical Evaluation (downloads of CAD files, 3D models, high score), and Promotional Engagement (webinar/email interactions).
    
- **Qualification Logic:** Contacts are assigned a cumulative score to determine qualification for sales handover; contacts that do not meet the criteria are marked as "exhausted" and re-enrolled in future nurturing campaigns.

### 3. Speed to Lead.png (Image)

- **Date:** Nov 12
    
- This image file provides a high-level visual representation of the future-state process flow.
    
- **Process Visualization:** The image shows a flow from various inbound lead sources (Web Traffic, Paid Advertising, Webinars) through enrichment tools like Clay and b2B for deanonymization and scoring.
    
- **Output Goal:** The flow explicitly leads to Tier 1 contacts, indicating the immediate goal is to identify and route the highest-value opportunities through the new architecture.

### 4. Taoglas Interview Agendas (Document)

- **Date:** Nov 25
    
- This document sets the goals for the discovery interviews, focusing on the Customer Service (CS) and Order Management teams.
    
- **CS/Order Management Focus:** The primary goal is to understand the dual role of the CS team (customer service and sales administrative support) and how this creates friction for sales.
    
- **Process Mapping:** A core goal is to map the entire quote-to-order workflow, including manual touchpoints with SAP, and to identify system usage gaps and opportunities for automation to free up CS capacity.

### 5. A8 Speed to Lead Scope Feedback (Document)

- **Date:** Dec 1
    
- This document serves as a Q&A and clarification on the assumptions and limits of the defined work scope.
    
- **Scope Clarification:** The consulting partner clarifies that the "Downstream sales pipeline is out of scope" means they will not be making changes to Taoglas' existing sales pipelines, implementing sales enablement, or configuring outside tools (like Tacton or a 3rd party scheduler).
    
- **Routing Approval:** It confirms that the final routing rules for the Speed-to-Lead process will be aligned upon through a workshop session with Taoglas' guidance, not simply provided by Taoglas in a list.

### 6. Taoglas Gap Analysis (Document)

- **Date:** Dec 5
    
- This document summarizes the core findings from discovery, highlighting foundational issues across departments that limit scalability and efficiency.
    
- **Key Issues:** The analysis identifies critical gaps, including Fragmented Lead Intake, the Absence of a dedicated Inside Sales function, inconsistent qualification/routing, unstandardized sales pipelines, and a highly manual process for SAP data re-entry.
    
- **Inside Sales Rationale:** The document positions Inside Sales as a future-state function that is a foundational enabler for the GTM strategy, intended to solve problems like unworked inbound leads, inconsistent routing, and missing lead data by routing leads based on standardized Tier 1/2/3 rules.

### 8. Taoglas HubSpot Reporting & Analytics Strategy (Document)

- **Date:** Dec 9
    
- This file details the challenges with the current reporting and defines the necessary metrics for the future state.
    
- **Current Reporting Failure:** The document stresses that HubSpot pipeline data is currently unusable for forecasting, leading to "failed revenue forecasting" and a reliance on manual spreadsheets instead of the CRM.
    
- **Critical Success Metrics:** Future success is defined by metrics like Pipeline Forecasting Reliability (pipeline data must drive long-term forecasts), Win Rate Accuracy, and Closed Won to Order Correlation (target of 100% validation between HubSpot and SAP orders).
