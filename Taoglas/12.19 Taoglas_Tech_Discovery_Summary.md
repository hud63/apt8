| **Questions** |
|---------------|

**Systems Overview & Current Architecture**
**✅ Primary Systems Identified**

- HubSpot (CRM - core platform)
- Tacton (CPQ - quoting system)
- SAP (ERP - orders, fulfillment, inventory, billing)
- Gotowebinar (marketing webinars)
- AEB (sanctions list/compliance checking)
- Zoominfo (data enrichment)
- Power BI (reporting/dashboards)
- Outlook (email, connected to HubSpot)
- Mouser/Digikey (distributors - antenna cable builder)

**⚠️ Future State Additions**

- Clay: B2B data aggregator replacing/augmenting Zoominfo
  - Will integrate with RB2B for website visitor identification
  - Potential to handle AEB sanctions checking before records enter HubSpot
  - "Why bring it over if we know it's not gonna pass the check anyway"

- Custom PIM: Being built internally to replace Excel-based product data management
  - Will feed HubSpot product library, Tacton, and website
  - Currently managed by in-house PHP developer

---

**Lead Sources & Data Entry Points**
**✅ Current Lead Sources**

- Website Forms:
  - 5 HubSpot native forms embedded on external website
  - Create companies and contacts in HubSpot

- Trade Shows:
  - Manually uploaded lists
  - No trade show software in use

- Email Campaigns:
  - HubSpot-managed

- Gotowebinar:
  - Registration via HubSpot forms
  - Attendance data syncs back to contacts
  - Day-of registrations can occur directly in Gotowebinar

**⚠️ Distributor Orders (Mouser/Digikey)**

- Antenna Cable Builder on Digikey website generates orders
- Orders come via email to US customer service team
- Taoglas processes and drop-ships directly to customer
- Company/contact creation is manual in HubSpot
- No direct integration exists

---

**Integration Architecture**
**✅ Native Integrations**

- Gotowebinar ↔ HubSpot (native connector)
- Zoominfo ↔ HubSpot (native connector for enrichment)
- Power BI ↔ HubSpot (native connector for reporting)
- Outlook ↔ HubSpot (native connector)

**⚠️ Custom Integrations**

- HubSpot ↔ AEB (Sanctions Checking):
  - Built with HubSpot webhooks via workflows
  - Custom PHP script on cloud web server (same server as website)
  - Passes company name + address to AEB
  - Returns compliance status to HubSpot company record

- HubSpot ↔ Tacton (CPQ):
  - Originally built by CPQ partner
  - Now hosted in-house on AWS EC2 server
  - Taoglas has full access to modify code
  - "We took it over about a month ago"

**❌ No Integration**

- SAP is completely siloed
  - No connection to HubSpot
  - No connection to Tacton (except for part number generation)
  - Separate product libraries maintained

---

**Tacton Integration Details**
**✅ Current Data Flow**

- Trigger: Deal stage changes to "Quote"
- Data sent to Tacton:
  - Company information
  - Contact information
  - Association labels determine distributor vs end customer

- Data returned from Tacton:
  - Quote preview
  - Product details
  - Note created on deal with attached PDF

**❌ Critical Gaps & Pain Points**

- No update sync:
  - "If the salesperson changes on a deal, it's never updated in Tacton"
  - Data only sent once, never resynced

- No pricing/quantity data returned:
  - No costs coming back to HubSpot
  - No prices coming back to HubSpot
  - No quantities coming back to HubSpot
  - "We just have here's what products we've quoted"

- Distributor handling issues:
  - Can only handle one distributor + one end customer per deal
  - Salespeople were putting 4-5 distributors in one deal
  - Creates pipeline reporting problems

- Workflow dependency on "Send Proposal":
  - "We're relying on people to click send proposal, which they don't always do"
  - Incomplete data return to HubSpot

**✅ Desired Improvements**

- Bring back cost, price, and quantity data
- Update proper deal values
- Consider using Quote object instead of Quote Previews
- "We're open to putting it in wherever is the best place to manage it"

---

**Tacton ↔ SAP Part Number Generation**
**✅ Working Well**

- Integration rebuilt in October
- When new custom part created in Tacton:
  - Click "Part Number Generation" button
  - Syncs automatically to SAP

- Volume: 420 part numbers created and pushed to SAP since October 28
- "That's one of the things that we've actually got quite well that we don't need to change"

---

**Product Information Management**
**⚠️ Current State: Fragmented**

- Tacton: Has product library + configurator rules
- SAP: Has product library + inventory
- HubSpot: Has product library (not well maintained)
  - Salespeople required to enter products
  - Products not up to date
  - Often entering "dummy information"
  - No prices in HubSpot

- Excel Sheet:
  - Houses every product attribute
  - Contains configurator rules (what cable works with what connector)
  - Only 2 people can update it
  - "If you put information in the wrong spot, you can break it"

**✅ Future State: Custom PIM**

- In-house PHP developer building database solution
- Will manage data and export files
- Goal: Change in one place, pushes to all systems
- Destinations: Website, HubSpot, Tacton, (SAP already connected via part number sync)

**Engineering Origin (New Parts)**

- Teamcenter: Product Lifecycle Management system for engineers
  - Stores raw materials, drawings, part specifications
  - Engineers assign raw material/engineering part numbers

- Products Team:
  - Assigns sales part numbers
  - Creates customer-facing descriptions
  - Currently enters into Excel (will be PIM in future)
  - Manually enters into SAP for first-time parts

---

**SAP Integration Opportunities**
**❌ Current State: Completely Siloed**

- Purchase orders processed in SAP
- Fulfillment handled in SAP
- Inventory managed in SAP
- Billing processed in SAP
- BP Codes (unique company identifiers) created in SAP

**⚠️ Known Pain Points**

- Team manually entering same information twice
- BP Codes in SAP need to sync back to HubSpot
  - Sometimes misalignment between systems

- Gap between deal closed won and purchase order:
  - Could be months between quote and actual PO
  - Manual update required when PO received

**✅ Opportunities Identified**

- Push closed won deals to SAP as sales orders or staging records
- Reduce manual input when purchase order arrives
- Sync company/contact information when deal closes
- Question: Does contact/company info ever change in SAP during fulfillment/billing?
  - Louise unsure - needs confirmation from SAP team

**❌ Email Address Uniqueness**

- "Usually the biggest problem between integrating HubSpot and other systems"
- HubSpot requires unique email addresses
- Unknown if SAP allows duplicate emails
- Setting is configured per SAP implementation

---

**Order Processing**
**✅ Distributor Orders (Large Distributors)**

- EDI integration: POs come in automatically
- Team reviews prices to ensure accuracy
- Minimal manual entry required

**⚠️ Distributor Orders (Small Regional)**

- Still send POs manually
- Require manual processing

**⚠️ Direct Orders**

- Come in via email
- Manually entered into SAP
- Opportunity for automation

**✅ In Progress: OCR AI Reader**

- Cadre working on OCR solution
- Will read PO documents
- Auto-populate order data into SAP
- Covers products and order details
- Does not cover customer/company sync

---

**Inventory Visibility**
**⚠️ Current Workaround**

- Salespeople don't have direct SAP access
- Inventory reports built in Power BI
- Sahem and team created lookup capability
- "Quick way around it" for PSCI/reseller teams

**❌ No Real-Time Inventory for Quoting**

- Tacton quoting doesn't check inventory
- "They're quoting for mass production from Taiwan"
- Inventory not relevant for most quotes

---

**Reporting Architecture**
**✅ Power BI Connected to HubSpot**

- Native integration in use
- Dashboards built by Sahem
- Inventory reports available
- Aileen manages reporting requirements

**⚠️ Pipeline Reporting Issues**

- Multiple deals for same sale (distributor handling)
- "Can't have a clean pipeline until we fix this"
- Not accurate representation of actual sales

---

**Team & Ownership**
**✅ Current Team Responsibilities**

- Louise Sinnott: Sales and marketing tools (HubSpot, Tacton integrations)
- Sahem: ERP integrations, SAP specialist, Power BI dashboards (returning January)
- Aileen: Finance/rev ops, reporting
- Lisa: Customer experience, customer service teams globally
- Alan & Taylor: Marketing, Clay implementation

**⚠️ Knowledge Gaps Identified**

- SAP integration details: Need Sahem, Aileen, or Lisa
- Clay implementation details: Need Alan or Taylor
- Product library usage intent: Need Taylor

**✅ Key Contact for SAP Deep Dive**

- Sahem: Former SAP Business One specialist, now on rev ops team
- Returning in January from Kenya
- "The missing piece with the integrations and full end-to-end"

---

**Future State: Clay Integration**
**✅ Planned Architecture**

- RB2B → Clay (website visitor identification)
- Zoominfo → Clay (data source)
- Multiple data sources → Clay (aggregation)
- Clay → HubSpot (enriched leads)

**⚠️ Open Questions**

- Will Clay also check AEB sanctions before HubSpot?
  - "If they do put it in Clay, is it just double checking?"
  - Likely keep AEB in both places:
    - Clay: Pre-filter before HubSpot
    - HubSpot: Catch manually created companies
  - "It probably makes sense to have it connected in both"

- Which specific Clay data sources are being used?
  - Industry-specific sources unknown
  - "Not sure if they even tell you which ones they're using in their scoring"

---

**Compliance: AEB Sanctions Checking**
**✅ Current Implementation**

- Custom PHP integration via webhooks
- Triggered from HubSpot workflows
- Passes: Company name + address
- Returns: Compliance status
- Stores: Result on company record

**✅ Integration Simplicity**

- "Not a difficult integration"
- "About 10 lines of information"
- Send data, run check, receive status

---

**Executive-Level Takeaways**

**🚨 Critical Issues**

- Tacton integration not returning pricing/quantity data
  - Can't see true deal values in HubSpot
  - Limits forecasting and pipeline accuracy

- Distributor handling in deals is broken
  - Multiple distributors per deal not supported
  - Creates pipeline distortion

- SAP completely disconnected
  - Duplicate data entry across systems
