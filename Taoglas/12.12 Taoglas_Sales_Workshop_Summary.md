| **Call Summary** |
|------------------|

**Workshop Overview & Strategic Context**

This workshop focused on standardizing Taoglas's sales processes across the organization to improve pipeline reporting accuracy and enable reliable forecasting. The core challenge: Taoglas currently operates three separate pipelines (Advanced Components, Distributor, and Direct) with inconsistent stage definitions, progression behaviors, and data quality issues. This fragmentation prevents the team from using HubSpot as a reliable source of truth for business decisions.

**Attendees:**
- Ashley Burgess (A8 - Leading the workshop)
- Taylor Kimmerle (Taoglas)
- Michael O'Regan (Taoglas)
- Noel Mythen (Taoglas)
- Louise Sinnott (Taoglas)

The primary goals of this engagement are to:
- Unify the three existing pipelines into a single standardized deal flow
- Create a Project custom object to track lifetime customer value across multiple purchase orders
- Automate deal progression wherever possible to reduce manual burden on sales teams
- Solve the "multiple distributor" problem where the same opportunity requires multiple quotes but artificially inflates pipeline value
- Establish required deal properties and clear stage definitions that align with actual business processes

---

**Current State: Three Pipelines Creating Reporting Chaos**

Taoglas currently operates with three distinct pipelines:

**1. Advanced Components Pipeline:**
- Lead → Quote → Final Review → Closed Won

**2. Distributor Pipeline:**
- Design In → Design Registration → Quote → Pre-Evaluation → Final Evaluation → Closed Won

**3. Direct Pipeline:**
- Discovery → Quote → Pre-Evaluation → Final Evaluation → Closed Won

⚠️ **Critical Issues with Current State:**

**Pipeline Value Inflation Due to Multiple Distributors**
- When 3-4 distributors need to quote the same project, Taoglas creates separate deals for each distributor
- This multiplies the true deal value by 3-4x in reporting
- Example: A $100K project becomes $300K-$400K in the pipeline when quoted to multiple distributors
- This makes pipeline reporting completely unreliable for forecasting
- Current workaround: None - teams know they "can't trust the numbers"

**Deal Stage Progression is Broken**
- Deals enter at "Lead" or equivalent first stage
- Most deals never move through intermediate stages (quote, evaluation)
- Deals commonly jump directly from Lead → Closed Won when a PO is received
- Analysis showed: Of 817 deals in Distributor pipeline, only 391 reached Quote stage, only 6 reached Design Registration, and 4 reached Final Evaluation
- The work IS being done, but it's happening outside HubSpot
- Pipeline stages don't reflect actual sales process

**Disconnect Between Deal Values and Actual Orders**
- Some team members enter "lifetime project value" as deal amount (e.g., $100K expected over project lifetime)
- First PO received is often a fraction of that (e.g., $10K)
- Deal closes at $100K but only $10K is realized
- Subsequent POs arrive, but process for updating closed deals is unclear
- Some reps go back and reopen closed deals to add new PO values
- This creates messy reporting and inaccurate revenue forecasting

**Regional and Team Inconsistencies**
- Different teams use different pipelines with different stage definitions
- Sales, Customer Success, and Distribution teams have different responsibilities for moving deals
- No clear ownership of who updates what and when
- Custom properties exist for distributor-specific workflows that don't apply to direct sales

---

**Proposed Solution: Unified Pipeline with Automation**

Ashley presented a unified pipeline that maps all three existing pipelines to a single, standardized flow:

**Unified Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Initial Evaluation** (formerly: Lead, Design In, Discovery)
2. **Quote Issued** (formerly: Quote across all pipelines)
3. **Follow Up** (new stage - automated after 30 days post-quote)
4. **Final Review** (formerly: Final Evaluation, Pre-Evaluation, Final Review)
5. **Closed Won / Closed Lost**

**Mapping from Current Pipelines:**
- Advanced Components: Lead → Qualification, Quote stays Quote, Final Review → Final Review
- Distributor: Design In → Initial Evaluation, Quote → Quote Issued, Design Registration eliminated, Final Evaluation → Final Review
- Direct: Discovery → Initial Evaluation, Quote → Quote Issued, Pre-Evaluation eliminated, Final Evaluation → Final Review

**Key Design Decisions Made During Workshop:**

**Initial Evaluation Before Quote (Not After)**
- Michael O'Regan recommended swapping the order: evaluation should come before quoting
- Rationale: Teams need to evaluate whether something is worth quoting before investing time in quote creation
- For distributor deals, design registration approval/decline happens before quote creation
- This applies to both distribution and direct sales processes

**"Follow Up" Stage Instead of "Evaluation"**
- Noel Mythen suggested renaming evaluation stages to "Needs Follow Up" or "Follow Up"
- Reasoning: Sales teams respond better to action-oriented language
- "Follow Up" creates a clear mental bucket: "These are deals that need my attention"
- "Evaluation" feels ambiguous - evaluation by whom? Of what?
- Team agreed this naming would drive better adoption

**Final Review = Active Deals Only**
- Follow Up becomes the "holding bucket" for all quoted deals awaiting customer response
- Final Review is reserved for deals with active engagement and soft commitment from customer
- Distinction: Follow Up = waiting to hear back; Final Review = customer has confirmed interest, waiting on their timeline
- This prevents everything from piling into one overloaded stage

**Automation Strategy to Reduce Manual Burden**

The team agreed on several automation triggers to move deals without requiring manual intervention:

**✅ Quote Issued → Tacton Quote Creation Triggers Stage Move**
- When CS or Distribution team creates a quote in Tacton, deal automatically moves from Initial Evaluation → Quote Issued
- This removes burden from sales team to manually update stage
- Tacton integration will trigger this workflow

**✅ Quote Issued → Follow Up After 30 Days (Automated)**
- If deal sits in Quote Issued stage for 30 days with no activity, automatically move to Follow Up
- This creates a natural trigger for sales engagement
- Prevents deals from sitting forgotten in Quote stage

**✅ SAP Order Creation → Closed Won (Automated)**
- When a PO is received and order is created in SAP, automatically move deal to Closed Won
- This ensures deal closure reflects actual order receipt, not just internal process completion
- Removes manual step of sellers having to remember to close deals

**⚠️ Initial Evaluation → Potential Auto-Sequence After Long Inactivity**
- If deals sit in Initial Evaluation for 90+ days with no progress, consider enrolling in automated marketing sequence
- This would keep deals "warm" without requiring sales to manually follow up on stalled early-stage opportunities
- Prevents Initial Evaluation from becoming a graveyard of forgotten leads

**Manual Progression Points:**
- Initial Evaluation → Quote Issued: CS/DS team responsibility when creating quote
- Follow Up → Final Review: Sales team moves deal when customer provides soft commitment
- Final Review → Closed Won/Lost: Automated by SAP order creation OR manual close lost by sales

**Concerns About Automation & Stage Buckets**

Taylor Kimmerle raised important caution: "I don't want it to move to a stage all of a sudden because then everything starts to pile into just because of flows. I don't want deals that fall into that doesn't mean the customer's uninterested just to be pushed out."

This concern shaped the decision to:
- Use Follow Up as a holding stage, not an automatic close-lost trigger
- Implement task reminders and sequences rather than auto-closing deals
- Use deal tags for aging indicators (30/60/90 days since quote) rather than moving to new stages
- Reserve auto-close for truly abandoned deals (no activity after 180+ days) with team notification before closure

Noel emphasized: "If there is something being done on it, then it'll never flag it." The team wants automation to surface neglected deals, not punish long sales cycles.

---

**The Multiple Distributor Problem: Still Unsolved**

Michael O'Regan asked directly: "Can we just put 4 deals under [one project] for 4 distis and have it just the same value then for rather than 4 separate deals?"

This is the critical question the engagement must solve.

**Current State:**
- Same project needs quotes from 3-4 different distributors
- Taoglas creates 3-4 separate deals (one per distributor)
- Each deal has the same value (e.g., $100K)
- Pipeline shows $300K-$400K when true opportunity value is $100K
- Reporting is unusable for forecasting

**Attempted Solution:**
- Ashley initially proposed allowing multiple quotes per deal (one quote per distributor)
- This would avoid deal duplication

**⚠️ Tacton Integration Limitation Discovered:**
- Louise Sinnott clarified: Tacton allows multiple quotes per deal
- BUT: Tacton only retains the most recent distributor's information
- If you create 3 quotes for 3 distributors, all 3 quotes show the same (last entered) distributor
- This breaks the distributor tracking requirement

**Current Status:**
- Ashley: "I'm trying really at all costs to avoid having duplicate deals in the system when we have multiple distributors."
- Aptitude 8's solution engineer (Michelle) is working on integration options
- Alternative solutions will be presented in early next week
- This is acknowledged as "one of the biggest issues we're facing currently"

Michael confirmed: "As long as we're looking at it, because I know it is an issue."

The team agreed this MUST be solved before go-live. Multiplying pipeline values by 3-4x makes the entire CRM unusable for forecasting.

---

**Project Object: Solving the Lifetime Value Tracking Problem**

Ashley proposed creating a **Project** custom object in HubSpot that sits "above" deals and tracks the overall customer engagement over time.

**The Problem Being Solved:**

Currently, when Taoglas wins business:
1. Initial deal is created with estimated annual usage (EAU) value, e.g., $100K/year over 3 years = $300K project
2. First PO arrives for $10K (initial order)
3. Deal closes at... $100K? $10K? Depends on who created it
4. Second PO arrives for $15K
5. Third PO arrives for $25K
6. Over time, $50K realized but deal shows $100K closed value
7. No clean way to track: Total project value vs. realized revenue vs. remaining expected revenue

**Additional complexity:**
- Reps need to forecast on expected PO values, not lifetime project values
- Current approach: Some reps create deal for full project value, others create deal for first PO only
- This inconsistency makes pipeline forecasting impossible
- Going back and modifying closed deals is messy and breaks reporting

**Proposed Data Model:**

```
Company (John Deere)
  ↓
Project (Gateway Module Integration - $300K lifetime value)
  ↓
  ├─ Deal 1 (Initial PO - $10K) - Closed Won
  ├─ Deal 2 (Production Ramp PO - $15K) - Closed Won
  ├─ Deal 3 (Q2 Production PO - $25K) - Quote Issued
  └─ Deal 4 (Q3 Production PO - $30K) - Initial Evaluation
```

**How This Works:**

**Project Level Properties:**
- Total estimated annual usage (EAU)
- Project duration (e.g., 3 years)
- Total lifetime value (calculated: EAU × years)
- Sum of all closed deals (actual realized revenue)
- Sum of all open deals (forecasted upcoming revenue)
- Project status (Active, On Hold, Closed)

**Deal Level Properties:**
- Deal amount = Expected PO value for THIS order only
- All deals associated to parent Project
- First deal goes through full pipeline (Initial Evaluation → Quote → Follow Up → Final Review → Closed Won)
- Subsequent deals are simpler (created when PO expected, closed when SAP order created)

**Benefits:**
- Pipeline forecasting based on actual expected POs, not inflated lifetime values
- Lifetime value tracking happens at Project level
- Each deal represents one discrete PO
- No need to reopen and modify closed deals
- Clear reporting: Project shows lifetime value, Deals show realized/forecasted revenue

**Key Question from Team: Who Creates What?**

Noel Mythen's concern: "Are we essentially having to create the same thing twice?"

This became the central design question: How do we avoid duplicate data entry while maintaining clean data structure?

**Initial Proposal (Ashley):**
- Create Project record first
- Then create Deal record
- Associate Deal to Project

**Team Reaction:**
- Noel: "That step is definitely gonna be missed, to be honest."
- Michael: "It's just more to... we just make it a process for CS."
- Concern: Adding extra step will create adoption resistance

**Final Decision: Create Deal, Auto-Generate Project**

The team landed on this flow:
1. Sales team creates Deal (as they do today - no change to their workflow)
2. Deal creation form includes fields for:
   - **First PO Expected Value** (becomes Deal Amount)
   - **Estimated Annual Usage (EAU)**
   - **Project Duration (Years)**
   - **Total Project Value** (calculated: EAU × Years)
3. Workflow automatically creates Project record from Deal data
4. Deal is associated to newly created Project
5. Subsequent POs: CS team creates new Deals associated to existing Project

**Noel's Key Requirement:**
"The only difference, I suppose, is just making sure that we have that clarification from first PO to EAU... Are we putting lifetime of the project over like a 3 to 5 year?"

**Taylor confirmed:**
"For the project, you put lifetime now. Deals just equate to initial PO value."

**Michael added:**
"Even realistically, they can be updated later on anyway. When CS was ordering, CS can go in and just update it."

This approach:
- ✅ No change to sales team workflow (still create deals)
- ✅ Captures lifetime value data at deal creation
- ✅ Auto-creates Project in background
- ✅ Allows CS to refine project data as deals progress
- ✅ Minimal additional fields at deal creation (2-3 new fields)

---

**Deal Progression: Who's Responsible for What?**

A critical topic emerged: With multiple stages, who is responsible for moving deals through the pipeline?

**Current State (Problematic):**
- Sales team is technically responsible for all stage movements
- Reality: Sales team focuses on selling, not updating CRM
- Noel: "Right now, we have to go through 5 different stages... whereas now it's essentially just two different stages. It's either follow up with the customer, or it's in final review."
- Result: Deals sit in whatever stage they're in until they close
- Pipeline reports are useless

**New State (Distributed Responsibility):**

**Initial Evaluation → Quote Issued:**
- **Responsibility:** CS (Customer Success) and DS (Distribution Support) teams
- **Trigger:** When they create a quote in Tacton
- **Automation:** Tacton quote creation triggers workflow → moves deal to Quote Issued
- **Sales burden:** None

**Quote Issued → Follow Up (After 30 Days):**
- **Responsibility:** Automated workflow
- **Trigger:** Deal in Quote Issued stage for 30+ days with no activity
- **Automation:** Time-based workflow moves deal automatically
- **Sales burden:** None
- **Additional automation:** Task created for sales rep: "Follow up with [Customer]"

**Follow Up → Final Review:**
- **Responsibility:** Sales team
- **Trigger:** Customer provides soft commitment (confirmed part selection, confirmed pricing, waiting on project timeline)
- **Manual:** Sales rep manually moves deal when engagement level warrants it
- **Sales burden:** One manual stage movement per deal (when customer commits)

**Final Review → Closed Won:**
- **Responsibility:** SAP integration (automated) OR Sales team (manual for closed lost)
- **Trigger:** Order created in SAP
- **Automation:** SAP order creation triggers workflow → moves deal to Closed Won
- **Sales burden:** None for closed won; manual close lost decision only

**Subsequent PO Deals (After Initial Deal Closed):**
- **Responsibility:** CS team
- **Process:** CS creates new deal associated to existing Project when they know another PO is expected
- **Deal amount:** Expected PO value only (not lifetime value)
- **Pipeline stages:** May enter at Quote Issued or Final Review depending on customer status
- **Sales burden:** None - CS owns ongoing order management

**Taylor summarized the distribution:**
"At this stage, we have DS and CS responsible for moving one perspective, automation for one perspective, and sales for one. So it's not total onus is on sales. We're the worst at moving stages. No offense, guys."

Michael: "No offense taken... Sales want to sell."

Noel: "There are real reasons... we're more interested in getting sales than being keyboard warriors."

This distributed responsibility model significantly reduces the CRM burden on sales while maintaining accurate pipeline data.

**Preventing Deal Stagnation: Tasks, Tags, and Sequences**

The team discussed how to prevent deals from getting "stuck" in stages without resorting to auto-closing deals prematurely.

**Problem:**
- Long sales cycles are normal for Taoglas (90-180+ days from quote to PO is common)
- But some deals genuinely fall off the radar
- Need to distinguish between "long sales cycle" and "abandoned opportunity"

**Solutions Discussed:**

**Deal Age Tags (Visual Indicators):**
- Ashley proposed tags that show on deal records: "Quoted 30 days ago," "Quoted 60 days ago," "Quoted 90 days ago"
- These appear in board view on the deal card
- Give visual indicator of which deals have been sitting longest
- Help prioritize follow-up efforts
- Don't move the deal, just flag it for attention

**Task Automation in Final Review:**
- Taylor: "Can we automate a task? Every 30 days, just send a task to the team saying, just do a quick check-in with the customer."
- Prevents deals in Final Review from going silent
- Creates recurring touchpoints without requiring sellers to remember
- Task assignment based on deal owner

**Sequences for Follow Up Stage:**
- Ashley suggested enrolling Follow Up deals into sequences after certain inactivity period
- Sequence would include:
  - Automated emails from salesperson
  - Tasks to call customer
  - Cadence of touches to re-engage
- Keeps deals warm without manual sales effort

**Notification-Based Auto-Close (Not Automatic):**
- For truly abandoned deals (180+ days, no activity, no response), send notification to Michael/Taylor
- "This deal has had no activity for X days. Close lost?"
- Give leadership visibility and decision rights
- Prevents automatic closure of deals that might still have potential

**Critical Distinction:**
- Taylor: "I don't want deals that fall into that [Follow Up stage] doesn't mean the customer's uninterested just to be pushed out."
- Long sales cycles are expected and acceptable
- Automation should surface neglected deals, not punish patient deal nurturing
- Sales cycles of 6+ months in Final Review are normal if customer is still engaged

---

**Required Deal Properties & Data Collection**

Ashley outlined that required properties will be established at deal creation and throughout the pipeline to ensure quote creation teams have needed information.

**Design Principle:**
"We have to find the balance there with not overloading people putting in information, but also having all the critical information needed to move forward."

**Staged Data Collection Approach:**
- Minimum required fields at deal creation (when sales enters opportunity)
- Additional fields become required as deal progresses
- Information required at Quote stage must be present before deal can move to Quote Issued
- This prevents "I need to chase down the sales rep to get this info before I can quote" scenarios

**Ashley noted:**
"You're not gonna know [everything] at creation, but you will by the time you get to some of these later stages. Kind of having those various fields peppered in throughout the process, roughly when you expect to know this information, also lightens that burden so you don't have, like, 'I've gotta do a whole page of information just to create a dang deal.'"

**Field Categories to be Defined:**
- Customer/company information (likely auto-populated from company record)
- Technical requirements (product specs, quantities, use case)
- Distributor information (for distributor deals)
- Pricing information (EAU, project duration, first PO value)
- Timeline information (expected PO date, project start date)

Specific fields will be mapped in follow-up sessions with input from CS, DS, and Sales teams on what they actually need to do their jobs.

**Integration Considerations: Tacton, SAP, and HubSpot**

Several integration points were discussed as critical to the unified pipeline working properly:

**Tacton (Quote Generation Tool):**
- ✅ Currently integrated with HubSpot
- ✅ Will trigger deal stage movement when quote is created
- ⚠️ **Known limitation:** Multiple quotes per deal don't maintain separate distributor information (all quotes show last-entered distributor)
- ⚠️ This limitation is the root cause of the multiple distributor problem
- 🔄 Michelle (A8 Solution Engineer) working on alternative approaches

**SAP (ERP / Order Management):**
- ⚠️ Currently NOT integrated with HubSpot
- 🎯 Target state: Bidirectional sync
  - SAP order creation → HubSpot deal closes won
  - HubSpot company creation → SAP customer record creation (or vice versa)
- This integration is critical for:
  - Automatic deal closure when PO received
  - Eliminating manual "we got a PO, go close the deal" process
  - Ensuring deal values match actual order values
- Integration approach TBD (likely middleware or direct API integration)

**Speed to Lead Workflow:**
- Ashley referenced existing speed-to-lead diagram
- Deal creation happens AFTER lead acceptance/rejection and tier assignment
- This remains separate from the deal pipeline stages
- Project and Deal creation occur after lead is qualified and accepted

**Quote Preview & Sales Order Detail Objects:**
- Existing custom objects in HubSpot
- Not shown in simplified data model presented
- Will remain and be associated appropriately to Deals and Projects

**Next Steps on Integrations:**
- Michelle (SE) scheduled to work on Taoglas integration scenarios
- Integration workshop planned (similar to this sales workshop)
- Timeline: Early next week for integration recommendations
- Goal: Finalize approach before build phase begins

---

**Team Dynamics & Change Management Considerations**

Several important team dynamics emerged during the discussion:

**Sales Team Realities:**
- Noel: "Sales guys are not making their own quotes at the moment."
- Michael: "No offense taken... we're more interested in getting sales than being keyboard warriors."
- Sales team will not reliably update CRM unless it's absolutely required for their workflow
- Any solution requiring consistent manual CRM updates from sales will fail

**CS and DS Team Capabilities:**
- These teams CAN handle CRM updates as part of their process
- Michael: "CS and DS can [move stages]. Every time they create a quote and send one out, let's just move on the stage, and that's a pretty simple thing for them to do."
- Workflow automation can trigger from their actions (quote creation, etc.)

**Regional Considerations:**
- Three pipelines exist partly due to different team structures
- Distribution team (DS) handles distributor relationships
- Sales team handles direct customers
- Customer Success (CS) supports both
- Unified pipeline must work for all three go-to-market motions

**Adoption Concerns:**
- Noel's repeated concern: "That's not going to be done, to be honest."
- Team is realistic about what will and won't be adopted
- Previous attempts at stage progression have failed
- This shaped the automation-heavy approach

**Leadership Buy-In:**
- Taylor and Michael (leadership) are actively engaged
- They understand current state is unusable
- Willing to invest in proper solution
- Committed to driving adoption across teams

---

**Workshop Outcomes & Decisions Made**

By the end of the workshop, the team had made concrete decisions:

**✅ Pipeline Structure Finalized:**
1. Initial Evaluation
2. Quote Issued
3. Follow Up
4. Final Review
5. Closed Won / Closed Lost

**✅ Automation Triggers Agreed:**
- Tacton quote creation → Quote Issued
- 30 days in Quote Issued → Follow Up
- SAP order creation → Closed Won
- Time-based tasks in Final Review
- Aging tags for visual indicators

**✅ Project Object Approach Confirmed:**
- Deal creation auto-generates Project
- Sales team creates Deals (no workflow change)
- Deal amount = Expected PO value
- Project tracks lifetime value
- CS creates subsequent PO deals

**✅ Responsibility Distribution Mapped:**
- CS/DS: Initial Evaluation → Quote Issued
- Automation: Quote Issued → Follow Up
- Sales: Follow Up → Final Review
- Automation/SAP: Final Review → Closed Won

**⚠️ Open Issues Requiring Resolution:**
- Multiple distributor quote problem (Michelle working on solutions)
- Specific required deal properties (to be defined in follow-up session)
- SAP integration approach (integration workshop scheduled)
- Tacton integration workarounds for distributor tracking

**📅 Next Steps:**
- Michelle to present integration options early next week
- Integration workshop to confirm technical approach
- Required deal properties mapping session
- Build phase to begin after integrations confirmed

---

**Success Criteria for This Initiative**

The workshop established clear success criteria:

1. **Single unified pipeline** used by all teams (Sales, CS, DS) for all deal types (direct, distributor, advanced components)

2. **Accurate pipeline reporting** that leadership can use for forecasting without having to "know the numbers are wrong"

3. **No duplicate deals** for multiple distributor scenarios - each opportunity appears once in pipeline with accurate value

4. **Automated deal progression** for at least 60% of stage movements, removing burden from sales team

5. **Project-level lifetime value tracking** separate from deal-level PO tracking, enabling both long-term planning and short-term forecasting

6. **Clean deal closure** triggered by SAP order creation, ensuring HubSpot reflects reality without manual intervention

7. **Minimal additional burden** on sales team - ideally no change to their workflow beyond adding 2-3 fields at deal creation

8. **Clear ownership model** where everyone knows who is responsible for what actions at what stages

**As Ashley summarized:**
"Anything that we can do to make this as user friendly as possible, I'm all for it. As long as we're keeping our reporting clean, making it more user friendly really supports keeping your data clean too."

---

**Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

**Risk: Sales team won't adopt if too burdensome**
- Mitigation: Automate stage movements, distribute responsibility to CS/DS, minimize manual updates required

**Risk: Multiple distributor problem remains unsolved**
- Mitigation: Dedicated SE resource working on integration solutions, integration workshop scheduled, commitment to solve before go-live

**Risk: Deals pile up in Follow Up stage becoming unmanageable**
- Mitigation: Aging tags, task automation, sequences, leadership visibility into aged deals

**Risk: Project creation adds complexity and reduces adoption**
- Mitigation: Auto-generate Projects from Deal creation, sales team doesn't change workflow

**Risk: Team reverts to old habits and pipeline falls back into disuse**
- Mitigation: Automation does most of the work, required fields prevent progression without data, SAP integration removes manual closure step

**Risk: Long sales cycles get incorrectly flagged as abandoned**
- Mitigation: Don't auto-close deals, use notifications instead of automatic actions, respect that 6-month cycles are normal

---

**Final Observations**

Ashley closed the workshop: "This has been a great conversation. I really appreciate you all and your participation, and I think we came up with some really good ideas."

The team demonstrated:
- **Realistic self-awareness** about what will and won't work ("Sales team won't do it")
- **Collaborative problem-solving** (swapping stage order, renaming stages, distributing responsibility)
- **Commitment to solving hard problems** (multiple distributor issue acknowledged as critical)
- **Willingness to change processes** to achieve clean data
- **Focus on outcomes** (accurate forecasting) rather than preserving existing workflows

The workshop successfully moved from "here's a proposal" to "here's what we're building together," with team members actively shaping the solution to fit their operational reality.

**Next milestone:** Integration workshop and SE recommendations on multiple distributor solutions.
