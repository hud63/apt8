| **Questions** |
|---------------|

**Core Systems Map (Current State)\
✅ Confirmed Primary Stack**

- **CRM:** HubSpot (Source of truth for Sales/Marketing)
- **Quoting/CPQ:** Tacton (Custom AWS EC2/PHP integration)
- **ERP/Operations:** SAP (Siloed - Financials, Fulfillment, Inventory)
- **Data/Enrichment:** ZoomInfo, Clay (Future State), Mouser, Digikey
- **Engagement:** GoToWebinar (Native), Microsoft Outlook (Native)
- **Compliance:** AEB (Custom PHP script for sanctions checks)

**Tacton Quoting & Integration Logic\
✅ Current Workflow**

- **Trigger:** Deal stage change to "Quote" pushes data to Tacton.
- **Data Passed:** Company and Contact information used to generate quotes.
- **Data Returned:** Quote preview, product descriptions, and a PDF file attached to a HubSpot note.
- **Sync Mechanism:** Hosted in-house on an AWS EC2 instance (recently moved from partner servers).

**⚠️ Major Sync Limitations**

- **One-Time Push:** Data is only sent to Tacton once at the trigger stage. If the salesperson or deal details change later, Tacton is never updated.
- **Missing Property Data:** Costs, prices, and quantities are not currently synced back to HubSpot properties.
  - > "We never could bring back values... that's why there's no values of what's quoted. It's just the description that comes back."
- **Workflow Dependency:** Data return to HubSpot depends on the user clicking "Send Proposal" in Tacton.
  - ❌ **Gap:** If users don't click the button, HubSpot has no record of the quote details.

**SAP Silo & Fulfillment Process\
🚨 Critical Gap: Integration Void**

- SAP is currently not connected to HubSpot or Tacton.
- **Manual "Closed Won" Loop:** There is no automated signal from SAP to HubSpot when a purchase order is fulfilled.
  - ⚠️ **Problem:** It can be months between a quote and a PO. Marketing/Sales have no visibility into the actual "Won" status unless manually updated.

**✅ Order Entry Status**

- **Large Distributors:** Use EDI for automatic entry into SAP.
- **Regional/Direct:** Manual entry from emailed POs.
- ⚠️ **OCR Initiative:** Internal teams (Cadre) are working on an AI OCR reader to automate emailed PO entry into SAP.

**Product Library & Engineering Flow\
⚠️ Current Fragmentation**

- **The "Excel Problem":** Product data (attributes, connectors, rules) is currently managed in a massive Excel file.
- **Teamcenter (PLM):** Engineers build raw materials and drawings here.
- **Handoff:** Engineering releases a part -> Products team assigns a sales part number -> Manual entry into SAP/HubSpot/Tacton.

**✅ Tacton → SAP Automation**

- A custom integration exists to push new part numbers from Tacton to SAP.
- **Volume:** ~420 part numbers created and pushed automatically since October 28.

**✅ Desired PIM State**

- Building an in-house PHP database (PIM) to replace the Excel sheets.
- **Goal:** Centralize all part data in one place and "distribute out" to HubSpot, Tacton, and the website.

**Sanctions & Compliance (AEB)\
✅ Current Custom Integration**

- Uses HubSpot Webhooks + Custom PHP script on the website server.
- Passes company name/address to AEB and returns a status to a HubSpot property.

**⚠️ Future State Logic**

- Discussing moving the AEB check "upstream" to **Clay**.
- **The Philosophy:** "If you do it in Clay first, you're not bringing crap into HubSpot."
- ❌ **Redundancy:** Need to keep the HubSpot integration for manually created companies that bypass the Clay flow.

**Lead Sources & Marketing Data\
✅ Native Integrations**

- **GoToWebinar:** Registration via HubSpot forms -> Data synced to GTW -> Attendance synced back.
- **ZoomInfo:** Direct enrichment into HubSpot.
- **Website:** 5 HubSpot native forms embedded in an external site.

**⚠️ External Data (Mouser/Digikey)**

- No direct integration.
- Orders come via a "Antenna & Cable Builder" tool on distributor sites.
- **Process:** Order email -> CS Team -> Manual entry into HubSpot/SAP.

**Team & Reporting Structure\
✅ Responsibilities**

- **Louise Sinnott:** Sales and Marketing tools (HubSpot, Tacton, Marketing apps).
- **Sahem (Returning Jan):** ERP (SAP), Reporting, Power BI.
