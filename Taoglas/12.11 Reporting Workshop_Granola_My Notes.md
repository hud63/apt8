Questions:

*how much of the key metrics did Ashley come up with vs provided from Taoglass?*

We had a RevOps call where we talked about some metrics, and I gathered some along the way with other discovery calls + a lot of those are standard/classic reports everyone wants/needs to see. I did have Claude group and format it + fill in some gaps (I also deleted several that Claude suggested)

- *for Ashley’s side, did Michelle have input ?*
  
Full transparency, this is the biggest or most complex Strategy project I've handled myself to date, and I def should have pulled Michelle in earlier, mainly from a PM perspective (for example, I assigned her most of these before Thanksgiving, but the task types were set to Customer Story, and I learned she filters those out and they needed to be Tasks in CU ![:face_with_spiral_eyes:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f635-200d-1f4ab@2x.png)). She's reviewed calls, and I see she has time blocked tomorrow to tackle a lot of the Taoglas integration work. But yeah, on me. I caused some delay here, but lesson learned!

*what happens next to this document/actions required to implement this reporting?*
*how will the PowerBI news effect user stories & other deliverables?* 

So we'll refine this doc based on what they're going to want to see in PowerBI vs HubSpot and that will def affect user stories and scope. I'm kinda glad we don't need to build all of these in HS because this would be a LARGE line item. We will need to make it clear which will be built as part of our Speed to Lead project and those won't be accounted for in the other scope. As part of our recap, I'll ask Eileen to specify which they will want in HubSpot. The full doc is their deliverable for our "Reporting Strategy & Design" story - these are recommended reports regardless of who builds them where, so if they want to use it as reference to build PowerBI reports, great! We just need to know which we need to plan for in HS. Then the Delivery team will have access to all our documentation when it's time for them to implement.

# A8 // Taoglas Reporting Workshop

Thu, 11 Dec 25

### Current State & Overarching Goals

- Cannot use pipeline data for forecasting - closed won deals don’t match actual SAP orders
    - Previous attempt at pipeline forecasting was “a disaster”
    - Fundamental disconnect between HubSpot closed won status and actual order fulfillment
    - No reliable correlation between deal closure and revenue recognition
- Goal: Clean pipeline that correlates to reality for business decisions
    - Enable HubSpot as primary source for company-wide forecasting
    - Establish trust in CRM data for strategic planning
    - Replace current anecdotal decision-making with data-driven insights
- Need closed won deals in HubSpot matching actual SAP orders
    - Bridge current gap between sales system and ERP
    - Ensure deal closure reflects actual purchase orders received
    - Enable accurate revenue tracking and pipeline conversion metrics
- Build confidence in data accuracy representing true Taoglas business state
    - Move from unreliable data to foundation for business decisions
    - Create single source of truth for sales performance
    - Enable accurate reporting across all business units

    - Creates multiple deal requirement for multi-distributor opportunities
    - Previous issues with pricing overrides and distributor information corruption
