#### Follow-up Meeting

- Reporting workshop on Thursday at 8AM Central

#### Business Goals

- Implement speed-to-lead using HubSpot's native scoring tool to improve maintenance, eliminate enrollment errors, and streamline customer tracking through a unified pipeline and new project object.

#### Pain Points

- The plants rapidly deteriorated from healthy to barren within a 10-day stretch.
- The region struggles to function effectively during bad weather conditions.

#### Features Interested

- Preference to use the native lead scoring tool supplemented with workflows for trigger actions like recycling exhausted lists.
- Interest in a unified pipeline with standardized stages, custom properties, and a new project object to track the full customer lifecycle.

#### Product Feedback

- Noted limitation of the native lead scoring tool in not allowing weighted subcategory routing; current needs do not prioritize this functionality.

#### Timeline

- Follow-up meeting occurred on 2025-12-09T11:00:00-06:00.
- Reporting workshop scheduled for Thursday at 8AM; similar sales and integration workshops are planned.
- Next steps include contract signing, followed by assignment of a delivery team and kickoff.

#### Decision Maker

- Key stakeholders include Taylor Kimmerle and Eileen Maceoin, with input from Alan, Louise (absent due to storm), and solution engineer Michelle.

#### Decision Criteria

#### Risk

- Risk of connectivity issues due to a storm affecting team members in Ireland.
- Technical risk if the native tool's limitations require custom workflows for advanced routing.

#### Lead Scoring Limitations
