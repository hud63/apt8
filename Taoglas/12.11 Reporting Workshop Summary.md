| Call Summary |
| :---- |

**Workshop Overview**

This session focused on presenting Aptitude 8's comprehensive reporting strategy for Taoglass, designed to establish HubSpot as a reliable source of truth for business decisions. The core problem: Taoglass cannot currently use pipeline data for forecasting due to data quality issues—closed won deals in HubSpot don't correlate to actual orders in SAP. The goal is to achieve clean, accurate data that enables confident business forecasting.

**Attendees:**

- Ashley Burgess (A8 \- Leading the workshop)  
- Taylor Kimmerle (Taoglass)  
- Eileen MacEoin (Taoglass)  
- Louise Sinnott (Taoglass)  
- Nakita McCarthy (Taoglass)

**Current State & Challenges**

The team acknowledged significant data quality issues preventing effective use of HubSpot:

- ⚠️ Pipeline data cannot be used for forecasting—"We tried it. It was a disaster"  
- ⚠️ Closed won deals don't match actual orders in SAP  
- ⚠️ HubSpot cannot currently support business decisions  
- ⚠️ Separate regional pipelines exist, creating inconsistency  
- ⚠️ Manual linking required between HubSpot deals and SAP bookings

Current workaround: Taoglass uses Power BI dashboards for most reporting, pulling from both SAP and HubSpot, with manual deal number application to link systems.

---

**Pipeline & Deal Reports**

The proposed reporting strategy includes classic pipeline visibility metrics:

- **Pipeline Overview**: Total pipeline value by stage, region, channel, vertical  
- **Trend Analysis**: Pipeline tracking over time against targets  
- **Deal Health Monitoring**:  
  - Where are deals getting stuck?  
  - Where are POs expected but not received?  
  - Closed won deals without corresponding SAP orders  
  - Expired/stale quotes (30, 60, 90 days without response)  
  - Deals sitting in first stage for extended periods  
- **Deal Velocity**:  
  - Time in each pipeline stage  
  - Deal creation velocity  
  - Time from qualification to quote  
  - Quote to closed won timing  
  - Order processing time

**Forecasting Capabilities**

- Expected production start date factoring (accounting for lead times)  
- EAU projections for future years (2026, 2027\)  
- Production ramp schedules  
- Deals expected to close per quarter  
- Pipeline to revenue conversion analysis

---

**Project Object Architecture**

A critical discussion emerged around how to handle ongoing customer relationships where POs continue arriving for years after initial deal closure.

**Current State:**

- Closed won deal receives first PO  
- Subsequent POs attach to the same closed won deal  
- Taylor noted: "I have situations where I've been receiving orders for 14 years on the same deal"

**Future State Vision:**

- Company object with multiple project records  
- Each project tracks its full lifecycle (design, proof of concept, production)  
- Each incoming PO becomes its own deal, moving through the pipeline  
- Deals roll up to projects for lifetime value tracking  
- Enables proper revenue recognition per phase

**Integration Question Raised:** Taylor asked about automation when POs arrive: "Does that mean we have to create a deal each time a PO shows up?"

- ✅ Kadri is working on PO reading/order entry tied to SAP  
- ⚠️ Not currently scoped for HubSpot integration  
- Eileen suggested: "I think we should look at it, though... ideally they do talk to each other"  
- Taylor's ideal: "If it auto puts in the SAP, then it auto creates the deal in HubSpot"  
- A8's Michelle is working on technical integration options—more information expected next week

---

**Win/Loss & Rep Performance Reports**

- Overall win rate by rep, region, vertical, distributor, deal size  
- Time-based comparisons  
- Rep performance metrics:  
  - Highest velocity  
  - Highest win rate  
  - Pipeline value per rep  
  - Closed won revenue  
  - Average cycle time  
  - Activity logging and correlation to performance  
- **Data Quality Score**: Completeness of required field entries  
- HubSpot login/usage tracking  
- Activity tracking toward goals

---

**Quote Performance Reports**

- Quote to closed won conversion rates (overall and segmented by rep, region, vertical, pricing range)  
- Quotes created vs. POs received

**Tacton Integration Note:** Louise clarified a Tacton limitation: "You can have multiple quotes per deal, but you can only have one end customer, one distributor on a deal."

The previous workaround of multiple distributors on one deal caused issues:

- Tacton couldn't switch between distributors  
- Pricing would show different rates but the wrong distributor  
- This drove the creation of separate deals per distributor

---

**Distributor Performance Reports**

Current state: Limited to knowing which distributors create the most deals and win the most deals.

Proposed metrics:

- Deal velocity by distributor  
- Win rates by distributor  
- Revenue attribution to distributor relationships  
- Competition analysis (distributor comparison)  
- Pricing analysis across distributors  
- **Branch-level performance**: If 200 branches globally exist with relationships from only 50, target outreach to the other 150

Eileen noted they're working on a new scoring system, but it's not tied to HubSpot deal data yet.

---

**Account & Company Health**

- Open deals visibility  
- Historical wins/losses  
- Both direct and distributor deals tracked at company level  
- Identification of most valuable clients  
- Opportunity prioritization

---

**Marketing Reports**

**Lead Generation:**

- Leads by source (with ROI on paid sources)  
- Volume trends over time (seasonality insights)  
- Most valuable lead sources (which convert to closed deals)  
- Lead quality scores using A1 through D4 qualification matrix  
- Behavioral/BANT scoring  
- Fit scoring against ICP

**Speed to Lead Metrics:**

- Time from contact creation to inside sales handoff  
- Percentage of leads created vs. handed off vs. staying in nurture  
- Score velocity (how quickly leads gain points)  
- Decay score impact on conversion  
- Contacts by score threshold distribution

*Note: Many of these are part of the "Speed to Lead" project already sent to Alan.*

---

**Pipeline Conversion & Lifecycle Reporting**

Customer lifecycle tracking:

- Contact created → MQL: Timeline  
- MQL → SQL (inside sales): Timeline  
- SQL → RSM acceptance/rejection: Timeline  
- Funnel drop-off rates at each stage  
- Conversion rates by source  
- Channel-wise pipeline value attribution (PSCI, A\&D, direct, distribution)

**Marketing Attribution (ROI Focus):**

- Pipeline value traced back to marketing lead sources  
- Closed won revenue attribution  
- Campaign-level performance:  
  - Email click rates  
  - Nurture campaigns → MQL conversion  
  - Re-engagement campaign success  
  - Download popularity  
  - Webinar attendance and engagement  
- Sales rejection rate and reasons  
- Speed to lead: MQL to first rep touch

---

**Inside Sales Capacity**

- How many leads are waiting in queue  
- Rep capacity and workload distribution  
- Contacts reached in a given timeframe

---

**Product Interest Tracking**

- Page views by product category (IoT, Industrial, Wi-Fi, etc.)  
- Content downloads by product category  
- Aggregated interest trends over time

---

**Data Quality & Exception Reporting**

**Missing Information Flags:**

- Company records missing fields CS needs for quotes/orders  
- Incomplete critical data causing downstream chasing

**Required Fields Discussion:** Eileen suggested making key fields mandatory to avoid exception reporting. Ashley cautioned about balance:

- "We want to balance those with making sure that it's information that the person putting it in will actually have"  
- Risk: People entering garbage data just to satisfy requirements  
- Risk: Slowing down the pipeline

**Duplicate Management:**

- Duplicate companies and contacts flagging  
- Merge policy  
- Branch relationship accuracy (parent company and branches may share domains)

**Data Enrichment Warning:** Louise flagged an issue with HubSpot's auto-enrichment: "Because they all have the same domain name... the data enrichment updated it to Texas, say, with all the cities, but they were all wrong."

---

**Call-Out Dashboard (The Dashboard You Don't Want to Be On)**

- Deals missing next steps  
- Deals with no activity in 30+ days (may need longer threshold for sales cycle)  
- Closed won deals without corresponding SAP orders

---

**Customer Service Reports**

Workload visibility for CS team:

- Deals created by CS vs. sales rep  
- Quotes created by CS  
- Companies/contacts created by CS  
- Data entry workload quantification

"Anecdotally, we've heard that CS is taking on maybe more than their fair share... now how does the data back that up?"

---

**A\&D (Aerospace & Defense) Reports**

Restricted access reports:

- A\&D-only pipeline isolation  
- ITAR restriction tracking (US-only viewing requirements)  
- A\&D deal performance metrics (win rate, conversion)

---

**Implementation Dependencies**

**Process Standardization (Foundation)**

- All regional sales teams using the same pipeline  
- Same stages with shared definitions  
- "Everybody rowing in the same direction"  
- "If this team is doing it this way and this team is doing it this way, then nothing means anything"

**Integration Requirements:**

- SAP ↔ HubSpot integration (flagged in red throughout document)  
- More information coming after technical recommendation

**Data Architecture:**

- Project custom object implementation  
- Book-to-deal alignment

**Training & Adoption:**

- Standard established → Training delivered → Continual reinforcement  
- Catch slippage early  
- Help reps understand: "We are forecasting an entire company off of the information that you are putting into the system"

---

**Current Reporting Infrastructure**

**Power BI as Primary Dashboard:**

- Management and leadership use Power BI for consolidated view  
- Pulls from both SAP and HubSpot  
- Sam is pulling deal and quote info into Power BI  
- "Power BI generally is what everybody uses every day"

**HubSpot for Operations:**

- CS team can use HubSpot directly (in it all day)  
- Some sales dashboards in HubSpot

**Recent Progress:**

- Deal data now flowing to Power BI (live as of recently)  
- Quote report being built (currently just raw quote data, adding structure)  
- Basic exception reporting exists: "Closed won deals that don't have bookings"

**Gap Identified:** The deal-to-booking link is very manual—requires deal number to be manually applied to SAP orders. Eileen noted an example where a customer bought parts through a distributor instead, creating tracking complications.

Suggestion: Consider a "Closed Won \- Distributor Fulfilled" status for deals where Taoglass won but the customer sourced through distribution.

---

**Next Steps**

- Tomorrow's call will include diagrams and process flow visuals  
- More conversational session with clarifying questions from A8  
- Integration workshop to follow once technical recommendations are finalized
