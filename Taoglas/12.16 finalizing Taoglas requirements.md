# 12.16 finalizing Taoglas requirements
Tue, 16 Dec 25
### Requirements Documentation Process Update
- Major lesson learned on requirements gathering approach after experiencing inefficiencies with current method
- New streamlined process implementation:
    - Draft requirements doc immediately after discovery calls rather than waiting
    - Build requirements call-by-call to maintain context and accuracy
    - Prevents AI context retention issues when handling multiple discovery calls
    - Eliminates need for retrospective requirements gathering which proved inefficient
- Created comprehensive rough draft Excel doc for Taoglas requirements
    - Currently formatted as personal notes and brain dump
    - Contains mix of requirements and acceptance criteria needing standardization
    - Includes call references and detailed notes for each discovery session
    - Will be transferred to official scoping template format this week
    - Service titles already structured for easy migration to final format
- Plan to populate suggested path, assumptions, and hour estimates once core requirements are finalized
### AI Tool Challenges and Strategic Solutions
- Claude AI experiencing severe performance degradation over past 3 weeks
    - Providing completely incorrect information despite specific file references
    - Ignoring direct instructions and going off in unrelated directions
    - Quality so poor that corrections became more work than starting fresh
    - Decided to give Claude 3-week break due to unusability
- Successfully migrated all Claude project files to ChatGPT project
    - Transferred rough draft requirements and example user stories for formatting
    - Working systematically through requirements validation against discovery calls
    - Using ChatGPT to flush out broader work streams from detailed requirements
    - Planning to check via Slack AI channel if Claude performance has improved
- Process includes validating requirements against each department discovery call
- Some rough format requirements will split into multiple detailed requirements during validation
### Taoglas Project Architecture and Coordination
- Strategic coordination established with Cadre (separate AI consulting firm)
    - Cadre focuses exclusively on AI initiatives and solutions for Taoglas
    - Clear operational division: Cadre avoids HubSpot entirely, team handles all HubSpot integration
    - Cadre expressed preference to avoid HubSpot complexity
- Comprehensive documentation of all Cadre initiatives to prevent workflow conflicts
    - Treating Cadre work as upstream input feeding into HubSpot solutions
    - Tailoring solutions to complement rather than contradict Cadre implementations
- Michelle leading integration design work this week as primary focus
    - Designing comprehensive HubSpot to SAP integration architecture
    - Creating future state mapping from integration perspective
    - Collecting detailed requirements for SAP connectivity
    - Coordinating integration points with AI solutions from Cadre
- Requirements completion dependent on Michelle’s integration design completion
- Updated pipeline structure and detailed process flow documented from previous workshop
### Tacton Integration Technical Workaround
- Persistent multi-quote distributor overwrite issue remains unresolved in Tacton configuration
- Detailed technical solution proposed for Tacton limitation:
    - Map Tacton deals to separate “distributor bid” custom object in HubSpot instead of deal object
    - Enables multiple distributor quotes without overwriting primary deal information
    - Custom object associates to main deal while maintaining data integrity
    - Preserves ability to track multiple quotes without HubSpot deal duplication
- Trade-offs and implications:
    - Still requires creating 3 separate Tacton deals (administrative burden remains)
    - If Tacton only used for CPQ, multiple deal creation becomes acceptable workflow
    - Creating separate quotes already required, so separate deals not significantly different
    - Solves data overwrite problem while maintaining functional requirements
- Architecture documented in visual process map with clear technical specifications
### Access Issues and Administrative Resolution
- Identified systemic Google Drive access problem affecting Mark’s document visibility
    - Cannot access Abundance 360 requirements documents in scoping template folder
    - Missing from company Google Drive permissions entirely
    - Unable to search or locate Michelle’s integration design documents
    - Pattern of access requests suggests broader provisioning issue rather than individual document permissions
- Root cause analysis revealed Mark absent from company Google Drive team member list
    - Should appear alongside all team members in shared drive permissions
    - Access issue extends beyond project-specific documents to company-wide resources
- Administrative action taken:
    - Submitted comprehensive POPS (IT support) request form for user account provisioning
    - Provided screenshots demonstrating missing access and expected placement
    - Included documentation showing where access should exist but doesn’t
- Expected resolution will provide full access to Google Drive resources without individual permission requests
- Michelle granted direct access to specific integration document as temporary workaround
