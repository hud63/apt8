Italy just quietly opened a backdoor to EU citizenship.,"Italy just quietly opened a backdoor to EU citizenship.  And nobody's talking about it. The new digital nomad visa isn't what you think.  It's not a one-year vacation permit. It's a fast-track to EU residency...and even citizenship. With tax breaks that'll make your accountant cry.  Here's what everyone's missing: This visa is renewable. Indefinitely. Two Years + Italian roots = Italian passport application. or Five years of renewals = permanent residency.  But wait. The tax situation is... ridiculous. If you're an employee: → 50% tax reduction  If you're self-employed: → 5% flat tax rate → For FIVE YEARS  I had to read that three times. Five. Percent. Flat. Tax.  Compare that to Golden Visas: • Portugal: €500,000 investment • Spain: €500,000 real estate • Greece: €250,000 minimum  Italy's asking price? Your laptop and a decent income.  The math is simple: Year 1-5: Digital nomad visa (renewable annually) Year 2: Apply for citizenship (if Italian descent) Year 5: Apply for permanent residency  Passport or Long-Term Resident EU permit lets you live, work, or study across Europe.  The income requirement varies by region. But we're talking €28,000-35,000 annually. Not €250,000 upfront.  This changes everything for remote workers. Your skills are now worth an EU passport. Not in 20 years. In 2.  While everyone's chasing Portuguese Golden Visas... Italy's handing out citizenship pathways to anyone with a Zoom account and decent WiFi.  The application opened in April 2024. Most people still don't know it exists.
