* "What would success look like if we could optimize your HubSpot implementation?"

  ## **﻿**

  ## **Value Proposition Development**

  ### **﻿**

  ### **Core Value Propositions**

  ### **Maximize Existing Investment**

* **Message:** "You've already invested significantly in HubSpot—let's ensure you're getting maximum return on that investment."  
* **Supporting Points:** Identify underutilized features, eliminate redundant costs, improve efficiency  
* **Proof Points:** ROI improvements from previous optimization engagements

  ### **Expert-Led Assessment**

* **Message:** "Our HubSpot experts will evaluate your setup against industry best practices and identify specific improvement opportunities."  
* **Supporting Points:** Certified expertise, proven methodology, objective assessment  
* **Proof Points:** Team certifications, case studies, industry recognition

  ### **Actionable Improvement Roadmap**

* **Message:** "Receive a prioritized roadmap of specific improvements that will drive measurable business impact."  
* **Supporting Points:** Clear priorities, implementation guidance, measurable outcomes  
* **Proof Points:** Sample roadmaps, success metrics, client testimonials

  ### **Competitive Advantage**

* **Message:** "Optimize your operations to outperform competitors and position for sustainable growth."  
* **Supporting Points:** Operational efficiency, better customer experience, scalable processes  
* **Proof Points:** Performance benchmarks, competitive analysis, growth enablement examples

  ### **﻿**

  ### **Objection Handling Framework**

  ### **"We're doing fine with our current setup"**

* **Response:** "That's great to hear\! Even high-performing teams often find significant opportunities when they take a fresh look at their setup. Our assessment helps identify the difference between 'fine' and 'optimized'—would you be interested in understanding what that gap might look like for your team?"  
* **Follow-up:** Share example of similar company that thought they were optimized but found significant improvements

  ### **"We don't have budget for optimization right now"**

* **Follow-up:** Provide ROI examples and discuss potential cost of not optimizing

  ### **"We don't have time for a big project right now"**

* **Response:** "The assessment itself is designed to be minimally disruptive to your team—we handle most of the analysis ourselves. The bigger question is whether you can afford not to optimize when small improvements could have significant impact on your results."  
* **Follow-up:** Emphasize low time investment for assessment vs. potential ongoing time savings

  ### **"Our team knows HubSpot pretty well"**

* **Response:** "Your team's HubSpot knowledge is definitely valuable\! Even HubSpot experts benefit from an external perspective and fresh eyes on their setup. We often find optimization opportunities that internal teams miss simply because they're too close to the day-to-day operations."

  # **Requirements and Customer Stories Playbook**

  ## **﻿**

  ## **Discovery Phase**

  ### **﻿**

  ### **Pre-Requisite Validation**

* Confirm all stakeholder interviews are complete, as the requirements are pulled directly from conversations with the client (pre-sales and during the Interviews phase of the Strategy engagement)  
* Compile \+ verify access to all interview recordings and Avoma transcripts (i.e. make sure you don’t overlook any meetings to be included)  
* Ensure client feedback on interview summaries has been incorporated

* Utilize Avoma transcripts and AI summarization to identify patterns and themes  
* Cross-reference stakeholder responses for consensus and conflicts (this should have been flagged during the Interview phase)  
* Review the documented terminology, processes, and technical specifications you developed during the Interview phase \- map these out if it’s helpful to have a visual during the User Story creation process (the map will be a separate deliverable anyway)

  ### **﻿**

  ### **Business Goals & Pain Points Extraction**

  ### ***Note: this is for internal use to stay organized \- not a client-facing deliverable***

* Create a comprehensive notes document with stakeholder quotes and examples  
* Document business rationale behind each requirement  
* Perform gap analysis between current and future state capabilities  
  * A gap analysis identifies the "distance" between where the client is today vs where they want to be, then documenting what needs to be built, changed, or implemented to bridge that gap.  
    * Current State \= How things work today (captured from interviews)  
    * Future State \= How things should work (derived from requirements)  
    * Gap \= What's missing or broken that prevents them from getting there; what intermediate steps need to be taken to get from Current State to Future State  
* Develop the recommended implementation path with phased approach  
  * Consult with Strategy Solutions Engineer (SSE) to validate approach as needed

  ### **﻿**

  ### **Epic & Story Framework**
