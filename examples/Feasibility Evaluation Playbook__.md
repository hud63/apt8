## **﻿**

## **Value Proposition Development**

### **﻿**

### **Core Value Propositions**

### **Risk Mitigation & Validation**

* **Message:** "Avoid costly platform implementation failures by validating HubSpot viability before making a major investment."  
* **Supporting Points:** Objective assessment, expert analysis, risk identification, informed decision-making  
* **Proof Points:** Case studies of prevented implementation failures, cost of wrong platform decisions

### **Expert Platform Evaluation**

* **Message:** "Leverage our deep HubSpot expertise to objectively assess platform fit against your specific requirements."  
* **Supporting Points:** HubSpot certification, proven methodology, industry experience, technical expertise  
* **Proof Points:** Team credentials, successful feasibility assessments, client testimonials

* **Supporting Points:** Multi-dimensional evaluation, quantitative analysis, actionable recommendations  
* **Proof Points:** Sample feasibility reports, detailed methodology, measurement frameworks

### **Competitive Intelligence**

* **Message:** "Get objective comparison of HubSpot against alternatives to ensure you select the best-fit platform."  
* **Supporting Points:** Platform expertise, unbiased analysis, comparative evaluation, decision frameworks  
* **Proof Points:** Platform comparison examples, vendor-neutral positioning, decision support tools

### **﻿**

### **Industry-Specific Value Propositions**

### **Healthcare & Life Sciences**

* **Message:** "Ensure HubSpot meets HIPAA, FDA, and other healthcare compliance requirements before implementation."  
* **Focus Areas:** Privacy compliance, audit trails, data security, regulatory reporting  
* **Proof Points:** Healthcare client success stories, compliance expertise, regulatory knowledge

* **Focus Areas:** Multi-entity management, complex pricing, inventory integration, global operations  
* **Proof Points:** Manufacturing client case studies, integration expertise, operational efficiency

## **﻿**

## **Objection Handling Framework**

### **﻿**

### **"Why can't we just do a HubSpot trial or demo?"**

* **Response:** "Trials and demos are great for understanding basic functionality, but they don't reveal how HubSpot will handle your specific business complexity, integrations, and regulatory requirements. Our feasibility evaluation goes deeper to assess technical viability, migration complexity, and potential implementation risks that could derail your project."  
* **Follow-up:** Share example of company that looked good in demo but faced major implementation challenges

### **﻿**

### **"We're already working directly with HubSpot sales"**

* **Response:** "That's excellent—HubSpot has a great team. Our role is complementary to theirs. While HubSpot shows you what the platform can do, we provide independent analysis of whether it's the right fit for your specific situation. Think of us as your technical due diligence partner to ensure you're making the best decision."  
* **Follow-up:** Position as additional expertise that protects their investment, not competition to HubSpot

### **﻿**

### **"This seems like an unnecessary step—can't we just start implementation?"**

* **Response:** "For organizations with straightforward requirements, that might work. But given the complexity you've described—your regulatory requirements, integration needs, and custom processes—jumping straight to implementation could be risky. The feasibility evaluation is insurance against costly mistakes and ensures smooth implementation when you do move forward."  
* **Follow-up:** Share cost comparison of feasibility evaluation vs. failed implementation recovery

### **﻿**

### **"We don't have budget for evaluation—we need to spend our money on implementation"**

* **Response:** "I completely understand wanting to maximize your implementation budget. The feasibility evaluation typically represents less than 5% of your total platform investment but can prevent implementation failures that cost 3-5x the original budget. Would it be helpful to understand how other similar companies have used feasibility evaluations to actually reduce their total implementation costs?"  
* **Follow-up:** Provide ROI examples and cost avoidance case studies

    * Current State \= How things work today (captured from interviews)  
    * Future State \= How things should work (derived from requirements)  
    * Gap \= What's missing or broken that prevents them from getting there; what intermediate steps need to be taken to get from Current State to Future State
