Ashley Marie Suski
It's negative 30. Thanks for choosing My birthday party. I mean, you're right. The holiday party. We are having a holiday party. It's just so happens that it's being held the day before my birthday. So. Oh, yes. Birthday party, I mean.

Ashley Marie Suski
Welcome. Welcome, everyone. I'm going to take a look at our attendance list. Please remember, this is not like a workshop brainstorm session of how we want Hubspot to work. We get to do that later. I'm gonna drop a feedback form in the chat. A is our integration partner, so they're going to be leading us through this overview. So anything like traffics process wise that you have questions on or would like to see it work differently, I'm gonna drop that in the chat, and so you can always leave it there, but that's something we could do at a later date. This is just simply how the system is going to be working at launch, and I think I saw Anna jump on.

Ashley Marie Suski
Do I have you, Anna? Yes. Actually, I'm here, but Danny, you guys met. Is Danny running today? She is going to be leading this this workshop.

Ashley Marie Suski
Alright. I'm going to start the recording.

Danielle Velt
Alright, Dani. We are all yours. Awesome. Thank you, Ashley. Hi, everybody. My name is Dani. I am on the Aptitude 8 team. As Ashley mentioned, they gave us a kind introduction, and I'm gonna be walking us through all of our train the trainer sessions. So you're gonna be hearing my voice and seeing my face a lot this week and next week. So just to give everybody an idea of what we're doing today. So our goal with this first session is really just a Hubspot overview. Right? So we wanna understand and kinda take a little tour, high level tour of workspaces, review and see different tabs, understand the main components of Hubspot, and get really familiar with those basics, and just generally see what's customizable.

Danielle Velt
Right? So you can think of this session as probably the most high level, and then as we go through all of these train the trainer sessions, we're gonna get more and more in depth. Right? We're gonna learn more and more how to actually edit and customize things, and we're gonna learn a little bit more about our specific process in Hubspot as well. This is gonna be very demo heavy, so I'm gonna be sharing my screen pretty much the whole time. So please make sure if you do end up having questions that you need to throw in the chat, feel free to do that throughout. Anna, on my side, will be collecting those questions. We're gonna leave some time at the end of this hour for q and a but otherwise, I'm just gonna be going through our demo together, and we'll be looking at all of those high level functionality pieces of Hubspot, and I would encourage you to try to have Hubspot up on your end if you can, if you're already either in the production or sandbox account. I will be doing this demo in production. I did just see a question come through of should we be in sandbox or production. I would recommend just poking around in production if you want to follow me exactly.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Awesome. With that, I'm going to share my screen.

Danielle Velt
Apologies. It is making me enable this for teams.

Jeremy Schlachet
Are we gonna change the dashboard with the front reporting, like, when you first open?

Augie Picado
Because mine's been going to reporting, which makes you log in to Power BI.

Danielle Velt
Yes. We can absolutely chat about that. That will be a part of, if not today, likely tomorrow's session, but we can definitely make it a point to discuss that today, how we customize that homepage.

Danielle Velt
Just working on sharing my screen here. It's just making me give Microsoft Teams some privileges.

Danielle Velt
Alright.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Ashley, it is actually making me quit and reopen. So if it's alright, I will take two seconds to do that.

Ashley Marie Suski
I will let you back in. I pinky promise.

Danielle Velt
Thank you. Apologies, everybody. One second.

Ashley Marie Suski
And I did drop the feedback form in the chat. So, again, remember, Dani is not a Trafix employee. She doesn't know how this will work best for us. She doesn't have any collaboration tools to, like, brainstorm with us during this. So this is just purely a training session. You can drop any feedback about how you would like it to look, what you think would be better for your team in that form, and we will get on it. Yes, mister Hazinga.

Tim Huizinga
Yeah. I just didn't wanna I I figured while we have a few minutes, I'd ask this out loud. I feel like there's been a little bit of contradictory so far. Should we be in sandbox or production? I've seen in the chat say production. I heard early on sandbox.

Ashley Marie Suski
You can be in production right now. Right now, she's just walking us through. Got it. So we have not done our final data pull from Netsuite either, so, like, you're good. Alright. Cool.

Tim Huizinga
I'll switch to production.

Mary Kate Heller
Sorry.

Danielle Velt
About that. I was muted. Thank you so much, everybody. Alright. Yes. Please be in production if you wanna follow along exactly, and as Ashley said, that final data pull has not been completed. So and we're actually gonna be looking at just a couple of test records as we go through today as well. So just keep that in mind.

Mary Kate Heller
Alright. I will share my screen.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Is everyone able to see my screen? We should be seeing some reports up in front of us and we are seeing Hubspot. Alright. Perfect, then I will get us going here. The first thing I actually wanna call out here is that right now, is going through a bit of a theme switch. So right now, what you're seeing is kind of this purple theme. You might be seeing more of like a navy blue theme. If you are seeing that and you just wanna make sure that you're on the same theme as me, because sometimes that can make it a little easier to follow along as well. Up in the very top right of our production account, you can click where it says traffics and then click on switch to either classic or new theme.

Danielle Velt
The classic is the old theme. So if you're seeing this kind of purple theme in front of you, that is the correct one, and that is the most up to date one. Alright. So we are first going to just talk a little bit about what is Hubspot. Right? So this is our CRM, our customer relationship management system that also has really powerful marketing, sales, and service tools, also expanding into commerce, automation, reporting, CMS, or web hosting, and development tools. So in this session, we're gonna be primarily focusing on CRM, but also a portion of sales, automation, and reporting, just getting that overview. So the first thing we're gonna talk about here is our navigation and icons that we see in front of us.

Danielle Velt
Right? When you first log in, you may be seeing a dashboard, and that's actually the first thing that I will call out for everybody. Here is setting your default home page. It can be a dashboard. It might by default be a dashboard. But what we wanna do to be able to edit this very quickly, up in the top right of Hubspot, we're gonna see traffics up in the very top right to the left of that is assistant. There'll be a little bell bell icon and then the settings gear icon. We're gonna go through all of these in just a second, but I do wanna just address that quick question that came up. So we're gonna click on this settings gear icon, and then you're gonna be led to this general preferences and profile section.

Danielle Velt
So this is specific to your user, and if you scroll all the way down on this page, there is a default section. It says choose your default home page. So this is where I have dashboard selected, but you can select anything else that you would like to see here. So we're gonna talk a lot about the sales workspace throughout these sessions. So for instance, I could select the sales workspace and I can save that, and it'll tell me that my settings have been saved. It'll just take a few minutes to take effect. For now, I'm gonna switch this back to dashboards, but just wanted to highlight that that is very customizable and you can change that at any time and that is specific to your user.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So we're first gonna talk a little bit about this sidebar navigation that we see, and then we're gonna talk about the top navigation in Hubspot. So if you click on the this Hubspot gear icon or sprocket icon, This is just the Hubspot logo. Right? If we ever click on that, that is what brings us right back to whatever our homepage is that we've set for ourselves. So in my case, it is a particular dashboard, and what I'm able to see directly under this is the bookmark section. So we can see here, I've actually already added a few different Sorry.

Jeremy Schlachet
Really quick. Just so that there's been some quest like, just I I figured this out, and I saw a lot of people. But if you go to the top right under the search hub and where it says sample data for people because ours defaulted to something to Power BI embedded. So if everyone just changed that to sample data, it will look the same as as Danielle's.

Danielle Velt
Oh, thank you, Jeremy. Thank you.

Jeremy Schlachet
Continue. Of.

Danielle Velt
Course. Yep. If you wanna see the exact same dashboard, that is totally understandable. Yes. So, if you set your home page to dashboards, you may see a different dashboard default. But, yes, you can just search right here if I click on the name of the dashboard I'm seeing and then search in the search bar for sample data. I can choose that dashboard, and then on the right hand side, there will be an actions button, and this is where I can choose to either set or remove it as the default dashboard. So not only is the dashboard section my default home page. Right? That's what I had set up in my settings before. I'm now setting which dashboard I want to be my default dashboard on this page.

Danielle Velt
So there's two levels of setting a default when you specifically make dashboards, that tool, your default home page. Okay. Perfect. Alright. So we're gonna come back up to bookmark. So what this is essentially allowing us to do is to set up quick access to different tools in Hubspot. So for example, if I'm a sales rep, I only want to see very specific tools within Hubspot, and I don't wanna have to go into all of the different icons that I see here to be able to access the tools and the features of Hubspot that are most relevant to me. Right? So in my case, I can add things like the sales workspace, companies, deals, contacts, and RFPs, and these are from all different navigation items that we're gonna talk about in a second.

Danielle Velt
If I come over to CRM, right below bookmarks on this left hand sidebar, this is where I'm gonna see all of the different CRM tools. So again, we're gonna learn more about very specific targeted tools in the CRM area as we go through this session and beyond. But just to kind of bring us right back to how I bookmarked these things, I can remove or add these from my bookmarks. So let's say I wanted to bookmark lists. I can click on this little bookmark icon. So very dynamically, I'm able to add or remove it from bookmarks, and then it shows up right at the bottom of my bookmarks. The only thing to note here is that your bookmarks will be added from top to bottom.

Danielle Velt
So right now, there isn't a way to drag and drop them per se. So we wanna make sure we're bookmarking them in the order that we want to see them. But what we're gonna see here are all of the different objects in Hubspot, and we'll talk a little bit more about what objects are and what records are in a second. But this is, again, all the different tools that exist within the CRM section. There's also the marketing section. Right? So this is where our marketing team might be creating email blasts, different social posts, things like that. There's content. So this is if you were hosting your website on Hubspot, you can see and edit your website pages, landing pages, your blog, and a lot of other content here as well, and then we have the sales section.

Danielle Velt
Again, we're gonna go deeper into a lot of these pieces throughout our sessions this week and next week. But you can see I've already bookmarked the sales workspace because that is gonna be really important for us as we go through our sessions. But I can also see things like target accounts, the meeting scheduler. There's a lot of very specific, sales tools here, sales analytics, etcetera, and then we have commerce. So this is if we are storing our products inside of Hubspot. If we are creating invoices or quotes from Hubspot, all of that lives here, and then we have the service section. So if we have our service team working out of Hubspot, they can access their help desk or the customer success workspace.

Danielle Velt
You can even host your knowledge base or have a customer portal in here as well, and then we have the data management section. So this is very operations and data related. So you can really focus on data quality here or data integrations, etcetera, and then we have an automation section here. We'll be going a little bit through this today. But we can create what's called workflow automation. So the word workflow is very specific Hubspot terminology. You might know it in some other spaces to mean something else, but in Hubspot, it is specifically related to automation. Meaning, there is a trigger event that then makes something else happen automatically, and then we have reporting towards the bottom here.

Danielle Velt
So this is where we can get to our dashboards, our reports, and if we set up any specific goals for different reps. Right? So if somebody has a revenue goal and you wanna tie that revenue goal to that rep, you can do that from there, and then we have the Breeze section. So this is related to Hubspot's AI, and we can really learn a lot more about the different AI tools and AI assistance that Hubspot has at your disposal here, and then there's a development section. This is very specific to custom development work that you may have a developer working on. Alright. I'm gonna move us up to the top navigation panel. There a lot.

Jeremy Schlachet
I think most of us don't have automation, and I think that's only for admin users. I think data and automation are not for the users. Is that right?

Danielle Velt
Yes. Okay. That is a great fallout. I appreciate that. Yes. You may not be seeing the automation section depending on your permissions. It is specific to particular admin permissions. Thank you so much. Alright. So we're gonna talk about this top navigation bar that we see. So we have the ability to do a few things. So we already talked about how to get back to our home page. This is the Hubspot gear icon up in the top left. But if we click on search Hubspot, this is where I can search for anything. So let's say I'm looking for a very specific contact, and I know the name of this contact. So I'm gonna type in their name. Hubspot is going to try to show me anything that matches the keywords that I just typed in to Hubspot.

Danielle Velt
So whether it's contacts or even call records that are related or something in the Hubspot marketplace. Right? There's different types of data that could show up based on what I'm searching here. So I can click on that contact record from here if something actually pops up that I know I need to get to, there's also a plus button right here. So this is the ability to create a new record, and again, we'll talk more about objects and records in just a second. We're just going through our navigation to start with. But I can create a new contact, company, deal, ticket, or task from right here. It's going to pop out a sidebar. We're gonna talk a lot more about this sidebar as we go on in our sessions when we talk more about creating different records, and then on the right hand side, we're gonna quickly go through these options here.

Danielle Velt
So if we are using Hubspot for calling, that's what we can, utilize this button for. So in our case, dial pad. Right? So, I would not recommend necessarily clicking and trying to test Dialpad at this very moment. Just know that that is here. But it will ask you to choose your calling provider and who you're actually planning to call through, then we also have this graduate cap here. This is the Hubspot Academy icon. So if there's something that you want to learn in Hubspot, you can search for it right here, and Hubspot will surface different lessons and also, different certifications for you. So if these are things that you want to upskill on, or you're just looking for a quick tutorial, you may be able to find it directly through Hubspot Academy, and then we have our little house icon here.

Danielle Velt
So this is where we can access the Hubspot marketplace, connected apps, and marketplace downloads. So the Hubspot marketplace, I'm gonna take us there just to show a quick preview. So there's lots of different things that you can search for in the marketplace, and it's broken out into these 4 areas. So Breeze agents, again, this is related to Hubspot's AI. So there are different AI agents that you can browse and choose to look into and install. There's different apps or applications. So if you want to integrate Hubspot with a different platform, you can search for those apps here, see what's required to actually integrate Hubspot with that system. There's also templates. This is more so related to the CMS hub portion of Hubspot.

Danielle Velt
Meaning, maybe I found a template that I'd like to download and I want to use it as my template for a particular website page, landing page, etcetera, and then solutions partners. So that's where a 8 falls in. Right? We can find different solutions partners to help enable us in the Hubspot world here. Alright. I'm gonna bring us back to our home page here. Back to my dashboard.

Jeremy Schlachet
For can we just pause for one sec? Sorry, and just make sure every everyone's been keeping up. Everyone's good so far on the traffic side? Any questions? I've gotten a few messages on the side just asking me questions, so we should use it here. Because if one person's having, we wanna make sure we're not all having it.

Danielle Velt
Absolutely. Yep. We can pause for a second here in case we need any big questions addressed. Looks like Susie and Anna have been answering a lot of the questions in the chat too, so keep that up.

Danielle Velt
Awesome. Thanks all.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Yeah. We'll take a few more pauses as we go forward. Appreciate everyone listening to me throughout all of this so far. Alright. So we left off just talking about our marketplace, connected apps, and marketplace downloads. So if I click on connected apps from my little house icon here, this is what brings me to looking at all of the different connected apps that I have in Hubspot. So again, this is Hubspot being integrated with another system. So great example is Dialpad. Right? So this is integrated with Hubspot. But I also may have my Google Calendar installed, Gmail, etcetera. Anything that I need to be able to integrate with Hubspot, I'll be able to find there. If I come back up to this house icon, I can also see marketplace downloads.

Danielle Velt
So this is again related to the CMS. If I'm hosting my website on Hubspot, I can download different themes or modules as well as different templates like we talked about before. Bring us back to our home page here. We also have a question mark icon up towards the top right here. So this is where we can chat to the support team. So Hubspot has a 24 7 support team. You can email them, call them, or chat with them at any time. You may be able to do a callback with them, but it will it should always tell you, if Hubspot support is open for callbacks versus you calling their number directly. Either way, there will always be, individual support if you need it just by clicking whichever mode you want to contact support through, and you can also view your support inbox.

Danielle Velt
So if you have a ticket with a Hubspot support rep that maybe maybe you had a chat that wasn't fully resolved by the end of the conversation, they're looking into something for you, you can get back to that ticket by viewing your support inbox, and they should follow up with you there. So lots of personalized support and help there, and then we have our settings gear icon. So we talked about this at the very beginning when we were looking at how to customize the home page. So if I click on the settings gear icon, this is gonna bring me again to my general preferences section, and we're gonna talk more about all of these personal profile customizations in just a few minutes here.

Danielle Velt
But this brings me to my general settings for the entire Hubspot account. So what I'm gonna see under this settings section on the left is all the different settings areas and options that I could possibly need to go into. Right? So there's since there's lots of different tools in Hubspot, there's lots of different settings to be able to customize. Even though this looks like a lot, it is very much going to depend on which tools we're actually using in Hubspot to be able to customize these different areas. Right? There are some that we may never need to look at because maybe we're not using something like tickets. Right? Maybe our service team is not in Hubspot, and then coming back up to our bell icon that's right next to the settings gear icon, this is where you will see any notifications that have come through in Hubspot.

Danielle Velt
So as you get started in Hubspot, you may see different bell notifications come through. An example of one may be you've been assigned to a new contact, you've been assigned to a new company, or you've been assigned to a new deal. Right? So you should see a one or a different number up here up next to your bell icon similar to, you know, your text messages in your phone. You'll see that you have some that are unread, and you can mark them as read. But you can always go back and see the history of all notifications you have or if you've left any in the trash, and then we have the AI assistant. So this is, again, our Breeze assistant.

Danielle Velt
So Breeze is kind of that Hubspot specific term here, but is it is essentially just our. AI general AI capabilities in the CRM. So I can ask the Breeze assistant anything, and it's going to look at all of the different data in the Hubspot CRM to try to answer my question. So I can say, can you please surface a contact. I should follow up with? Just as an example. So it's gonna function very similarly to other AI tools you might have used in the past. But what's really nice about this is we don't have to take data outside of Hubspot into a different AI tool to be able to get information and answers. Right? We can just keep all of it in Hubspot if we're trying to reference data that's inside of the system anyway.

Danielle Velt
So for me, I don't think I have any unworked contacts personally. So that's why it's not giving me exactly, a specific contact to follow up with, but it is still, you know, trying to push the conversation forward. Right? What what am I exactly looking for? Right? The AI assistant is just asking me to give a a little bit more detail so that it can help, and I can close the assistant at any time, and then the last piece we're gonna talk about in this top navigation is where we see traffics up in the top right here. So this is going to be a drop down, and what you're going to see is your name as it appears in the traffics Hubspot account.

Danielle Velt
You will see your email address that is tied to your user and to your name. I will also see my profile and preferences button. So if I click on that, that is the same as clicking on the settings gear icon. Right? So we've clicked on the settings gear icon. We've gotten to this profile section, and you can do the same by clicking on profile and preferences. Again, this is the theme section. So if you want to go back to that classic theme that's navy blue, you can do that here. But you can also just choose to update to this purple, updated Hubspot theme, and you can also give feedback on the theme from right here. Hubspot likes to collect feedback at different points when we're using the CRM, and then I can also see the specific account that I am using.

Danielle Velt
Right? So the number that appears under where it says traffics under account, that is the number of our Hubspot account, or that's the account ID, essentially. I can create a new user in this Hubspot account by clicking on create a user. It'll bring me to that starting page and prompt me there. I can look at Hubspot's pricing and features. So that's gonna bring me out to a completely different, page on the Hubspot website. If I have access to account and billing, I can click on account and billing, and I can see what are the subscription levels that we're currently paying for, any discount, details, or subscription renewal details, all live here. I can also see Hubspot credits.

Danielle Velt
So this is related specifically to data enrichment. So if we are choosing to either manually or automatically enrich Hubspot data, for example, on a company record, then that's what will, this Hubspot credits, option will be related to, I can also look at Hubspot product updates at any time. So what's really nice is this is just another section of your Hubspot account that will surface to you, hey, this is everything new in Hubspot over the last week, the last 30 days, 90 days, whatever time frame you want to see. It'll also show you any product updates that are related to very new in development features, what is in beta, meaning that it hasn't gone to full release just yet.

Danielle Velt
But you may be able to opt yourself or the traffics account into that beta. I would say proceed with caution on that. We wanna make sure we have a very small group of folks opting the entire account into different betas. But then there's also just notifications of this feature has gone live to all accounts, or maybe there's a feature every now and again that is being deprecated because of lack of use, etcetera, and then this is another link to the Hubspot Academy. So this is similar to and will bring you to the same area as the graduate cap icon up in the top right, and then there's a training and services page. This also brings you back out to, the Hubspot website, and then there is a project section.

Danielle Velt
So Hubspot has a more minor projects tool where you can manage projects inside of this account as well, and then you can view Hubspot's privacy policy and sign out of your account. Alright. I'm going to pause here. Just wanna check in and get get a temp check with everyone if there's any major questions that we need to answer.

Jeremy Schlachet
I'd say the only thing is, like, anything with admin rights, we should probably just skip over because 95% of people on this call won't have any admin rights in the system to add users and and things like that.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. I would say the only thing that we would touch base on today that would require some higher admin privileges would be the workflow automation. So if we want to forego that piece, happy to be flexible there. Augie, that's your call.

Ashley Marie Suski
We're learning it along with everyone else at the same time, so it is kind of important that we touch on it.

Augie Picado
Yeah. But just to be clear, you're talking about editing the workflows. We're not gonna have anybody on this call editing workflows, but actually going through the workflows or I'm sorry. Are we talking workflows or are we talking sequences?

Danielle Velt
Workflows, Augie.

Augie Picado
Yeah. I mean, nobody on this call is gonna be editing workflows. They will, at at some point, be editing sequences.

Danielle Velt
Okay. Yeah. My plan was, to touch on workflows would really just be more so not necessarily how to build a workflow on this particular call, but just giving an overview of this is what each workflow how the workflow organization looks. Right? We have a list of different workflows, and how we can just view them at this point in time. But if we wanna forego that, that is completely okay. As well.

Augie Picado
I think we can go over that. That's way too much detail for the folks on the call.

Danielle Velt
Yep. We'll keep it higher level. We will not go into building one. Okay. Perfect. Alright. We are actually on the correct page that we need to navigate to next. So we are gonna talk about this general settings and profile section. So in the top right, we wanna click on that settings gear icon. It's right between the bell and the question mark. So the settings gear will bring us right to our profile section, and this is where we're gonna live for a little bit here. So, what we're going to see here is first a profile tab under this general section, and just to give us a little more context here, so under the your preferences section right here on the left, this is general.

Danielle Velt
So this is where it will default you to whenever you hit that settings gear icon. In this profile section, I can update my profile image at any time. So if I hover over profile image, it'll ask me do I wanna upload an image, use a Gravatar, or remove this image, and I can also edit my first name and last name at any point in time if I need to, I can edit the language that I need to see all of the data in in Hubspot. So in my case, English, and then also my date, time, and number format. Right? So if I was international in The UK, for example, I can choose United Kingdom rather than US.

Danielle Velt
But if US is correct and it shows you an example of that format here, then we can keep this selected as United States, and then you can enter your phone number here, but please keep in mind that this is not specific for calling. As it says here, Hubspot may just use this phone number to contact you about security events. So that is why we would enter phone number here, but we'll talk about calling in a second here, and then this is again our default section. So if I want to set a different default home page, I can do that from here, and most of the tools that we just saw in the left sidebar navigation will appear here to be set as our default home page.

Danielle Velt
So you can customize that at any time. Just remember, it's gonna have a little pop up that just tells you it's gonna take a few minutes for Hubspot to apply that new default home page. Alright, and the next important thing to get set up and what is important before we go further into overviews on different tools is to be able to connect different pieces here. So connect our email address, connect the phone number for calling, connect our calendar. So under this email section, it's going to say that you can connect a personal email. When it says personal email, think of this as your company email address, your traffic's email address. I've gotten that question sometimes that the verbiage is a little strange, but it just means that you are the only person that uses that email address.

Danielle Velt
So it just should not be a shared email address such as one that a service team might use together, like support@traffics.com. So if you click on connect personal email, it'll bring you through the prompts to connect your inbox. So it'll have you, enter your inbox name, so @traffics.com and click the through the prompts to connect your email address. It should just be a few clicks to get it set up, and once it's set up, it's going to look like this. So you'll be able to see which inbox it is, what is the inbox type for so for me, that's Gmail. But for you, it might be. Office 3 65 for example, and then if I need to, I can disable it.

Danielle Velt
I can also completely remove it if I need to, and I can also edit my default signature. So I can choose either my global default signature or another one, and if I scroll down just a little bit to this configure section, this is where I can actually manage email signatures. So I can enter a new signature here and give it a name.

Ashley Marie Suski
And we actually don't even have to worry about this part because Front automates our signatures for us. Perfect. Fantastic, then I will leave it at that.

Danielle Velt
Because it really is just either simple or if you have HTML to paste here, you can do either.

Jeremy Schlachet
If the email's coming out of Hubspot, though, will our signature show up on an email that goes outbound?

Ashley Marie Suski
It's connected through front. That's how it's connect. Yeah. Great.

Jeremy Schlachet
Then we could skip all that.

Danielle Velt
Yep. Perfect. I do wanna just very briefly mention this. I know we will be using Dialpad integrated with Hubspot for calling. But if you did ever need to add a phone number here under Hubspot calling, this calling tab, I can click on add phone number. It'll just have you go through one quick prompt to verify your phone number either through a text message or phone call to get your phone number connected, and that would be for outbound calling. So if you were making calls out different contacts, and then we have the calendar section. So this should be important for reps using Hubspot. They will want to make sure that they connect their calendars so that they can utilize that and view it from inside of the sales workspace, and we'll see that a little bit more closely when we look at the sales workspace.

Danielle Velt
So right now, we can see that I have a calendar connected here. You will likely not see something here. You will see a button that says connect calendar. We can only connect one calendar per one user in Hubspot at a time, which is why there's not another option for me to add another calendar. So just be aware of that. Best practice would be, for example, my email address danielle@aptitude8.com. Ideally, that would be the email address connected to my user and the calendar that is connected to my Hubspot user. You can technically connect a different calendar, but again, not necessarily best practice. Alright. One more important thing to call out here is actually the tasks tab. So there will be tasks that you either create manually for yourself or maybe an automated task from Hubspot that gets assigned to you based on a particular process that you're involved in.

Danielle Velt
So if I would like to, just for my personal user, I can actually choose a default for the manual tasks that I create for myself. When do I, by default, want the due date to be or the due time, etcetera, and do I want any reminder emails from Hubspot about, tasks that have an upcoming due date? Alright. I'm gonna pause here and just quickly see if we have any questions before we continue.

Augie Picado
So, Danielle, I just wanna do go ahead, Ashley.

Ashley Marie Suski
Anna, it looks like we do have some people that do not have any permission sets. They just have seats in the product production environment. So we're going to need to, I'm having them like it so we can update their permission sets right now. Like the comment, if you cannot edit the things she's editing right.

Anastasia Zhukova
Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.

Augie Picado
Alright, and Daniele, III just wanna point out that the folks that are on this call are people that are gonna go back and reinforce the use and training of this with their people. So we're gonna do end user training in January. I just wanna kinda level set. You you gave a super high level overview, but there's some features that we don't wanna confuse the folks on this call with. Admin stuff, stuff that's like the nuts and bolts and guts about how workflows work. I would just consider that before you dive into a section that these are not folks that are like Jeremy or me or Ashley or a few others that are likely gonna be tweaking things. These people are gonna be using and holding their teams accountable for using the system on a day to day basis just to Kind of make sure we keep this a little bit more to the point.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Absolutely. Alright. We're gonna pivot, and we're going to talk more about some new terminology. So I mentioned before that we were gonna talk more about objects, records, etcetera. So just so that we have a visual up in front of us here, on the left sidebar navigation, let's click on the CRM booklet icon here and then click on contacts from there. So this is going to bring us to our contacts home page. I wanna get us set up and ready to understand the new terminology here. So I've mentioned objects a couple of times. In the CRM, we need both objects and records to be able to keep track of all of our customer relationships. So an object is a type of data that represents a business relationship or a process, and then we also have records.

Danielle Velt
So a record being a single entry or file within the Hubspot CRM system that holds information about a specific entity. So a contact, a company, a deal, and so we're looking at contacts right now. So this is the individual human being that you actually talk to, right? So this is john smith at a b c logistics, for example. This is where emails and calls get logged. Right? Those actual activities that you're that are you're carrying out with a specific individual. So if I come to my company's homepage here and I can dynamically search for the contact that I need. So I have a demo contact here for us. I can click right into it, and I'm gonna see a lot of different information.

Danielle Velt
So we're gonna go a lot further into this type of view tomorrow. But again, I wanna keep this a little bit more of an overview for now. So this is my contact record. Right? This is an individual person that I could converse with over email, over a call. I can have a task related to them. I can leave a note on their record. Right? So it's one record to one individual. We also have companies as an object type, and there can be many different company records in Hubspot. So if I come all the way back to my CRM section again, I can click on companies.

Danielle Velt
And it's gonna load up all the different companies that exist in Hubspot, and again, I'm gonna pull up my example company record here. But the company is the business entity. So, again, ABC Logistics, this can be thought of as that parent record for all people, all those contacts, and deals, and so we can also have different activities that log to this record. Right? So there's there's information at the individual level and then there's information at that organization level or as Hubspot calls it, a company, and then we also have deals. So again, I'm gonna come right back to CRM, click on deals, and this is where I can see all of the potential sales with a dollar amount attached.

Danielle Velt
This is where we can track the revenue pipeline, RFPs, and quotes. So deals progress through different stages inside of a pipeline, and we'll talk more about that as our sessions go on. But I can, again, search for a different deal record, and I have one example deal right here, and again, similar layout to what we just saw as a really quick brief overview, but we're seeing information very specific to this particular sale. So the deal is meant to represent the sale of a particular particular product or service. Alright. That's a lot of new terminology. So I'm gonna take a pause here in case we have any questions.

Jeremy Schlachet
So just so everyone's aware, and everyone did do the prework, I hope, a deal is now an opportunity is now a deal. There was a great thing that Forrest put together that showed old Netsuite terminology and new Hubspot terminology. Make sure the record one's a little confusing. A record's inside of the of the the record is inside of the company. But the deal and all that thank you, Nicole. Perfect. That should answer any question.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. Yes. You should have a little cheat sheet just to kind of link up Netsuite terminology to Hubspot terminology. Alright, and I wanna also call out so, again, we're gonna dive a lot further into what really makes up these different records for all of these different object types. But what I do wanna call out is so I'm looking at the deal record, my example deal record right now. On the right hand side, I can see different associations. So I can see that this deal is associated directly to my individual, my contact, and the company or the organization. So because those associations exist, what that allows us to do is really connect the different activities that are happening across those objects, and also, it really powers different automations and reporting capabilities.

Danielle Velt
So it's very important to have those direct associations, and it's very convenient that you can see those from each of these records. So if I click on my contact record from this right sidebar of this record, If I scroll down a bit, I'm gonna be able to see that company record because it's associated both to this contact and the deal that I was just on, and the deal is associated here as well.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I wanna also call out here life cycle stages. So this is another new Hubspot terminology piece. So on any contact or company record, I can see the life cycle stage here. So life cycle stage tracks a prospect through the full buyer's journey. So it's a person or a company that has not yet done business with you. So we're in Hubspot, we're tracking how qualified this prospect is using life cycle stages such as the ones we see here. Right? So lead, marketing qualified lead, sales qualified lead, opportunity, customer, etcetera. So we have a lot of different life cycle stages that we see here, and I can see that the life cycle stage has already automatically been set on this contact record, and that's because I've already created an example deal here.

Danielle Velt
The deal being associated means that the life cycle stage is now at the point of opportunity. So that's just a little call out based on the terminology in Netsuite that we're pretty familiar with. Right? Opportunity is what we call a deal, but the life cycle stage is typically called opportunity when we get to that that point of a deal being created. We can also set the lead status. You can set this on the contact level, but we're likely gonna be a lot more familiar with or need to be more familiar with the status on the company level. So I'm gonna on the right hand side here, click on the company record, and on the left hand side, right at the very top of this section of fields and information about my company record, I'm gonna see a status.

Danielle Velt
So I can set the status any way that I need to, there's gonna be a lot of different options here based on whether someone is a customer or a prospect. Right, and there will be different automations that will automatically set the status of the company for you. So that's something that is very process specific that we'll end up talking a little bit more about as we get into these sessions. But just wanna call that out that that is how our status looks on the contact and the company record in Hubspot. So little bit different than your Netsuite status that you might be familiar with.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I'm gonna take one more quick pause here and just doing a time check. We have a second here just to really briefly look at the sales workspace and dashboards, and then we're gonna flip over to q and a.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I know Anna's looking in the chat and Ashley's looking in the chat, so I will leave that to them and I will keep going. Alright. So we just looked at if I come back to my contact section here, and again, remember that you can bookmark these different tools. Right? So making it a lot easier for me to access these areas in the future. Right? So perfect example of how, you know, there's a lot of different tools in the sales section. Maybe I only need the sales workspace, so I'm gonna bookmark that, and speaking of, I do wanna bring us into the sales workspace just briefly, and again, we're gonna we're gonna go a lot deeper into this during future sessions. But if I come to my little funnel icon in the left sidebar navigation, I'm gonna click on sales workspace, and remember, you can bookmark that.

Danielle Velt
And I'm gonna see a lot here. So again, this is all to come, but wanna give everybody a quick summary of the sales workspace. So the sales workspace is really, really a helpful space so that our sales reps are not clicking around endlessly, having too many clicks to get to what they need in order to actually carry out their job day to day and the tasks and the actions that they need to perform. So there are lots of different tabs up here. There's going to be a summary tab, and this sales workspace is going to be specific to that rep. So I should see my own name up at the top here, and this is my space specifically.

Danielle Velt
So under the summary, I can see quick links to go to my deals, contacts, or companies. I can also see a brief overview of my tasks. So I can either look at all tasks, what's due today, what's overdue. Great. I'm doing great. I don't have anything overdue, or due tomorrow, and from right here, can create a task or I can click start tasks. We're gonna go a lot deeper into this later. But if I click on start tasks, it takes me into my task queue. So it's taking me right through all of the different tasks that I have set up. I'm gonna bring us back just using the back button, and if Hubspot detects any specific outreach activities or suggested tasks or even follow up meetings for you, those will surface here.

Danielle Velt
Hubspot will tell you exactly what it's trying to surface to you here. So it's trying to help sales reps be very proactive. So for outreach activities, you can review drafted emails from your prospecting agent and complete tasks from your sequence. Right? So as our sales reps really get into those outreach activities, they will see more surface there or suggested tasks. So based on my recent activity, what are the recommended actions to take to try to boost my pipeline and close deals faster? Anywhere you see an eye icon, Hubspot is trying to tell us more about how a number is being calculated or how different proactive recommendations are being surfaced. On the right hand side, I can see my schedule.

Danielle Velt
So if I've connected my calendar, it'll tell me, you know, my tasks are due, and I have different calendar items here. I can see insights as well. So. I can look at different sales pipelines. Is it the core sales pipeline, the pop pipeline, or the quick sale pipeline that I need to see my closed one revenue and goal attainment, and I can also choose to quickly filter this for this month or this quarter. One thing I will call out here is we can see so much more reporting than this in other areas of Hubspot, and you can even embed a dashboard into the sales workspace. This insights tab is meant to just be a quick fast look for the sales rep.

Danielle Velt
So this is not by no means is this as far as they can go with reporting at all. This is just the tip of the iceberg. They can also see their meetings delivered, pipeline created, and their activities this week. So this is very individualized, and then if I click on companies, this is where I'm going to see either all companies. So this is very similar to that company's homepage that we just looked at. So we're essentially seeing companies but inside of the sales work space. Again, making it even easier for sales reps not to have to go very far to get to where they need to, so I'm seeing all companies, but I can also see just the companies that I am the owner of.

Danielle Velt
So Hubspot will show you right here that you are filtered for yourself as the company owner right here. We're gonna go a lot deeper into all of this. So again, this is just our overview point. We can also see our deals. So there's a lot of different views here again. I can see all deals or maybe just my deals. Right? This is the the demo deal that I created before. So I can see that I'm the deal owner of that deal and I can take action on them. I can also click on the tasks section here and it's going to show me all of my tasks in a list view. So on the summary page, was just seeing a quick overview of what's the total count of tasks.

Danielle Velt
Here, I can also see my list of tasks. I can make any edits to these tasks if I need to before I choose to start all on the right hand side here. So you can start your task queue from right here or from that summary page, and then I can also see my schedule from here as well. So it'll show me all the different meetings I have, and then I can see a dashboard as well. So if I click on add dashboard in the center of this area here, I can select a dashboard to add here, and I can also choose do I want everyone to see this dashboard in the workspace or just specific teams and users. So if it's just myself that I wanna see this for, I could set that as well.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I'm gonna pause here, and we'll pivot over to q and a for our last few minutes here.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Let's see. Anna, let me know if there's any questions we should address first.

Anastasia Zhukova
I think there's a couple things that we need to take to our internal meeting weekly meeting tomorrow, but. I believe that we answered most of the questions in the chat. I wanted to highlight the notifications in the settings. I think Jeremy brought that up that we can adjust that. By default, there is a lot of notifications are that are enabled, and if we can go back to that section just kinda to show where to adjust them, there is a wealth of notification. So, Danielle, I think if you go over that, that'll be beneficial.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Absolutely. So if we come back to our settings gear icon up in the top right of our navigation, just to reorient ourselves. So we were previously on this general tab looking at those individual user settings. The other individual user setting is the notifications tab. So I can choose how I want to get notified. So is it through email, bell notifications that we talked about before, browser notifications, or pop ups? So I can enable any or all of these, and then I choose what I get notified about if I scroll a little bit further down. So I can choose to expand all topics or collapse them all, but it depends on what section you're looking to see what the options are.

Danielle Velt
Right? So if I scroll down just as an example to contacts and companies, this will likely be a pretty relevant one for our reps. Right? So let's say they they want to get notified if a company record is assigned to them or a contact record is assigned to them. They can choose over on the right here, how do I want to get notified? Do I want it to be through browser, pop up, bell, or email, or a combination of these? If any of these options on the right here, pop up browser, bell, or email, if it is grayed out or it has a couple of dashes here, that just means that that notification channel isn't available for that particular type of notification or that topic.

Danielle Velt
So just be aware of that. It doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with Hubspot or wrong with your settings. There's just some types of notifications that might not be currently enabled as a feature at the moment for a specific method of notification. But, yes, there's a lot here to discover. But I would say the most important pieces that, we should be looking at first are contacts and companies and deals. So there is a deal section here as well. You can get notified when a deal is assigned to you, a deal stage update happens, etcetera.

Danielle Velt
Do we have any other specific questions on the notification section that I can cover right now?

Danielle Velt
Alright. Any other questions that we wanna address in our last 4 minutes here?

Scott Sears
Hey, Danielle. Real quick. If we were to change some of the contacts and company notifications in Sandbox, does that convert over to the live environment?

Danielle Velt
That is a great question. So because you have two different users, one in sandbox and one in production, your notification settings are specific to that environment. K. Okay. So just be aware of that.

Scott Sears
So we're gonna do it again.

Tim Huizinga
Thanks.

Danielle Velt
No problem. Any other questions that we should cover?

Anastasia Zhukova
Danny, I we have another question. Can we get notifications from our team? Can you please cover, like, tagging people in comments and how you get notifications about those?

Danielle Velt
Oh, yes. Tagging individuals on our team.

Anastasia Zhukova
Yes. That's correct, and how to adjust those notifications?

Danielle Velt
Absolutely. So. I'm actually going to duplicate this tab for a moment, and I'm gonna bring us back to my example company record.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So this was my record. So if I want to specifically notify one of my teammates, I can, for example, do what's called leaving a note on this record. So I'm in my company record here. In the top left, I see this create a note button. So if I click on this, I can leave a note here and say, please take a look at this records updates, and then I can choose the at symbol and then start typing my teammate's name. So I'm gonna use Anna as an example. I'm gonna see all the different users that match what I've already typed. So we have a few different Annas, but I I need to choose a specific person here.

Danielle Velt
So their name will appear in bold as soon as I've selected them. So I can hit create note and complete a task, for example, and now I can see my note has been logged here, and if Anna's notifications are set up successfully, she will get a notification ping that I just tagged her on this record. So if I come back to my notifications here, I'm gonna come back down to this contacts and company section, and what I want to enable is you're mentioned on a company record. So that was what's called a mention. Right? So doing that at symbol, typing the at symbol, and then your teammate's name, and then selecting them and making sure that their name appears in bold so you know that you've selected them.

Danielle Velt
So if Anna has, let's let's say, say, just bell notifications on for mentions on a company record, then she would get that that one icon, that red one appearing in that bell icon up in the top right. This is a great feature, but I think my question was more surrounding.

Tim Huizinga
If someone from my team, let's say, creates a deal.

Danielle Velt
That, you know, is brand new as, you know, being their, manager, will I get notified of that deal being created, or is there a way to get notified of that, specific deal? Oh, okay to get notified that somebody on your team has been assigned to a new deal.

Tim Huizinga
Yeah. Exactly, or yeah, whatever it might be.

Ashley Marie Suski
Yeah. That would be a workflow, and we have those created. Each DOS I have to look again at those specific ones for deals. Is something if it's not already, like, put that do me a favor, Tony. Put that in the feedback form. Just be like, I want a notification every time someone in my team creates a deal. So I can have that in my list. Yeah, or changes the data on the deal or anything like that. Right? So.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Great question. Yes. That that is a great call out. The notification options that we see here are not the end all be all. These are the basic notifications that Hubspot allows for very quickly just with the check of that box. But, yes, workflow automation is what allows us to create more customized notifications that get sent based on different triggers. So perfect. Okay. Alright. I know we are at time. Is there anything else before we jump off here? Anything else. Anna, feel free to call it out or Ashley. Anything else major that we should discuss really quickly before we hop?

Anastasia Zhukova
Actually, I have quite a few notes taken out. I'll send a recap here shortly, but thank you. Thank you, guys. I'm not sure if anybody on traffic's team has any questions, but I'm good on my side.

Ashley Marie Suski
We are going to send out a recap of the overview and just, like, a little activity that you can do for post work, and we will see you guys in the morning.

Mary Kate Heller
Yeah. We will drop the link. It'll be in the same kind of learning path that the prework was in, but it'll be, like, a slightly different course. It will recap what happened in today's training with an activity if you want to walk through, but there's also a knowledge check for yourself of.

Ashley Marie Suski
How sweet is that? Hoosier fans now because that's the cutest thing I've ever heard.

Francis Coderre
I know. A real football foundation to be proud of. That is so cute.

Anastasia Zhukova
I love it.

Ashley Marie Suski
We took our kids to the Purdue game. It was freezing. Was.

Hannah Peth
It? Yeah. But it was still fun.

Curtis Tate
Alright.

Ashley Marie Suski
I'm going to remind everyone today, we are just training and learning. We are not workshopping this session. We are just learning how the system is working right now for us to use when we get in there. I will drop in the chat again anything that you want enhanced or to work for your team, give us in that feedback form. We are going to collect it all and action it. I'm going to start the recording. Danny is here. I see Anna is here. Welcome to day two. All yours, Danny.

Danielle Velt
Awesome. Thanks, Ashley. Hello again, everybody. Happy to see you. Alright. So this is our session two. This is prospecting and research. So we're going to be reviewing our sales workspace and tabs, working with contacts, companies, how to actually look up different information about companies, update statuses, all of that good stuff. So it's gonna be a very similar process to yesterday where I will be sharing my screen, and we'll be going through a demo, and we are in our traffic's production account. So feel free to follow along there, and I'll be taking some pauses as we go throughout our time today similar to yesterday just in case there's any big questions that come up that we need to, resolve, and we will still leave a few minutes at the end same as yesterday for some q and a, and Anna and Ashley will be looking at the chat in the meantime. Alright? Really quick.

Ashley Marie Suski
I just wanna let you know, know yourself. If you know if you follow along with her that you're going to be, like, investigating on your own, don't do that. Just watch Danny. Stay on track. We will get lots of time to explore more and deeper. But if you if that's how your brain works and that's really how you grasp it, feel free to do that way. But if not, just follow along with Danny. We have a work a work session later today. So if you have any questions you wanna explore, ask questions, then you're you can do it then.

Danielle Velt
Awesome. Thanks, Ashley. Yep. You can also go back to this recording at any point in time. So if it's more distracting for you to follow along, absolutely just take a look at my screen. One call out from yesterday that I just wanna make here first is that when we were previewing the sales workspace yesterday, I know there was a dashboard tab there all the way to the right in the sales workspace. Please note right now, you may or may not see that dashboard tab in your sales workspace. So that screen might look slightly different from what you're seeing. If it is, please just tag, Anna and Ashley in the chat just so that we can surface that and we can, take some next steps there.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Awesome. So we covered a lot yesterday, especially with a review of new terminology. Right? What is a particular thing in Netsuite and what is it in Hubspot? So I'm gonna do a really quick recap of that terminology for us. So yesterday, we talked about objects. So if we come over into Hubspot and we go to our CRM little booklet icon in the left sidebar navigation, everything we're seeing up top here, contacts, companies, deals, etcetera, these are all objects in Hubspot. Right? So we need both objects and records to keep track of all of those customer relationships, and an object is a type of data that represents a business relationship or process, and if I come into my contact section, so this is our whole list of all of the contact records that exist in the Hubspot CRM. So if we remember from yesterday, a record is a single entry or file within the Hubspot CRM that holds information about a specific entity. So in this case, a contact. Right? If I click into this particular contact record, I am seeing this individual's information.

Danielle Velt
And again, a contact is that individual human being that you're talking with. So john smith at a b c logistics, and this is where different activities are logged on that record. So emails, calls, tasks, and notes, for example, and then we also have companies. So this is the actual business entity or the organization, and this could be thought of as that parent record for all people and deals because you can directly associate contacts and companies and deals with one another, and then we also have deals. We're gonna be talking a lot more about deals in our future sessions. Really getting a little deeper into things with deals tomorrow in particular, but just wanna mention here again, a deal is a potential sale with a dollar amount attached.

Danielle Velt
So this is where we track the revenue pipeline, RFPs, and quotes, and deals progress through stages inside of a pipeline. So you can think of that as a Netsuite opportunity. I'm actually gonna come right back into this contact record just to highlight life cycle stage one more time because we did talk about this a little bit yesterday. So the life cycle stage in Hubspot, this is a very specific Hubspot term, and it tracks the prospect through the entire buyer's journey. So it's a person or company that has not yet done business with you, and in Hubspot, we're tracking how qualified this lead is using these different stages. So from lead all the way through customer, for example, and then there might even be some other cases where we need to define somebody as, for example, a former customer or dormant customer, or terminated, for example.

Danielle Velt
So we can customize those things, but the typical life cycle stages you may see are are usually lead to marketing qualified lead, to sales qualified lead, to opportunity, and to customer, and again, this is tracked on the company level and tracked on the contact level, and then we also have lead status. So in our Hubspot, we're gonna see two different things here. We're gonna see the lead status on the contact level. So Hubspot comes with different options here if you need to track where you are at in communication with a particular contact. If you want to remember that, oh, yes, I did connect with them or I only attempted to contact them. I sent them an email, they haven't replied yet, and if I come over to a company record, I'm just gonna take this one as a quick example here.

Danielle Velt
I'm going to see a particular status here under my primary information section about the company. So there's lead status on the contact level, and then there is status on the company level. So that will tell you where where am I at with this entire company at large. Alright. I'm gonna bring us back to the home page here. I'm gonna pause here just in case there are any big questions on the terminology that we went over yesterday and just recapped now.

Ashley Marie Suski
We do have a question in the chat that's wondering the difference between objects and records. I am pulling it up right now. But if you because I wanna get the verbiage completely correct because I'm new to it too. But if you want to explain it, we would love that as well.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Happy to go over that again, and please let me know if we need a different a different type of explanation of this. I'm happy to provide that. But, essentially, the object is the type of data that represents a business relationship or process. Right? So a contact is a certain type of business relationship. Right? That's an individual person that you are speaking with through email, making a call to, etcetera. A company, same exact thing. This is also another object at that higher level. So the business relationship there is that that is an actual organization that then holds different contacts. They can be associated to different contacts, and a deal is more on the process side of things, like I just mentioned.

Danielle Velt
So a deal is that opportunity to sell a product or service, and that deal is going through different stages or milestones from that beginning point where the opportunity is is identified all the way through either ultimately being lost or won, and within these different objects so these we can really think of it in very, simple terms that a contact is an object type. Right? Just think about the word itself. That's an object. But if I come into my contact section in Hubspot, all of these different entries here that I see so there's one, two, 3 that I just clicked on, Those are all individual records. Right? So the object is generally contacts, companies, deals, and then we have individual entries because these are individual people or individual companies or individual deals. I hope that helps, but please let us know if we need to follow up on that again later.

Danielle Velt
Alright. We're gonna pivot back over to the home page again. So we're gonna click on that Hubspot sprocket icon in the top left, and I'm just gonna do a very quick recap of our sidebar navigation. So if we remember from yesterday, so in the top left corner, the Hubspot icon is gonna bring us back to whatever home page we've set, and then right underneath that, we have our bookmark section. This is gonna be very, important for everyone, for all of you and for all of the reps to be able to just bookmark the tools that they need to use on a daily basis. Right? Making it really easy for them to find what they need so that you have bookmarks directly inside of Hubspot and they don't need to bookmark them to their browser, for example, and remember, if we so if we come back down to the CRM section here, I can click either add or remove from bookmark.

Danielle Velt
So if you haven't added it to your bookmarks yet, a particular section, I can choose to add that to my bookmarks or remove it if it's already there. So as soon as I click on add to bookmarks, just as an example, if I add loads and then come up to bookmarks, it's immediately there at the bottom, and then we have our marketing section, content, sales. This is likely where we're all gonna be living a lot more is the sales workspace in particular. Commerce service, data management, automation, reporting is gonna be important here as well, and then Breeze and development, and remember, Breeze is Hubspot's AI, and we're gonna do a really, really quick recap before we dive into contacts.

Danielle Velt
Just a quick recap of our top navigation as well. So remember, at any point, I can use what's called the global navigation in Hubspot to search for anything. So if I want to search for I'm just gonna search my own name and see what comes up. So there are different contacts that match this name. There's even different companies that might match or email addresses. So I can find records really easily by searching in the global search. I can also click on this plus button that says create new, and this is where we can create new records. Right? These are new records. So I can create a new contact record that will then live underneath that full contact object, for example, and then over on the right, I can make a call through whatever calling instance I need to right here, whether it's Hubspot, Dialpad, etcetera.

Danielle Velt
I can enter your Hubspot Academy to try and learn a little bit more about generally how Hubspot works. The training that we're doing now is a lot more specific to our instance, but in Hubspot Academy, you can learn more generally about Hubspot tools and methodology, and then we have the house icon, which has, again, our Hubspot marketplace connected apps and marketplace downloads. So this is just overall where you can download different templates, and also applications, right, if you want to integrate a particular application with Hubspot, and then our question mark icon, this is where we can get direct, one on one support, so from Hubspot support. These will be real people, that you can either chat with, email, or you can call them, and then we have our settings gear icon.

Danielle Velt
Remember, this takes us over to our preferences section. So this is your preferences. It'll bring you to the general section under your profile, and you also have your notifications section here as well that you can customize, and then we have the bell icon, so this is where any notifications that you receive over time. You'll have an unread section, and then you can see all of your past notifications that you might have already read, and then this is AI assistance. So this is Hubspot's AI. Right? We can ask about anything that has to do with our Hubspot CRM and get an answer, and then this is just our account drop down. So again, you're gonna see that you are logged in as yourself here, and you can go over to your profile and preferences.

Danielle Velt
Please, try to make sure that you're using the most up to date theme. So right here, it should say switch to the classic theme. We're not gonna click on that because classic is the old theme, and then I'm gonna see my account name and number and then a few other options here at the bottom. Just, again, some additional links to the same things we've been seeing like Hubspot Academy. Alright. I'm gonna pivot us over to contacts. So just to give everyone an idea of, again, what what we're really focused on today is how can we create, search, review data, edit, and customize different views across contacts and companies, and also within the sales workspace. So we're gonna be looking at contacts first, and then we're gonna pivot over to the sales workspace to talk about companies, and then tomorrow, we're going to continue the conversation, but more focused on deals in the sales workspace just to give everybody an idea of where we're going.

Danielle Velt
So I'm gonna bring us back over to our CRM booklet icon on the left sidebar navigation, and I'm gonna click on contacts, or again, if you've bookmarked it, you can practice using your bookmarks and choose contacts from your bookmarks bar. Alright. So we've seen this screen already a couple of times, but we didn't really deep dive into it yesterday. So we're gonna talk about how we actually create a new contact. Before we go into all the customization that we can do on this page, I wanna take us kind of in a bit of an order of operations here. So if I come to this contacts home page, this is where I can manually create a new contact if I need to, so over in the top right, I can click on add contacts and then create new, and this is where I can create my contact.

Danielle Velt
So one important thing to note is that in Hubspot, one contact can have one email address, or one email address can only belong to one contact is the right way to put that. So, for example, if I add my email address here, Hubspot is gonna say, hold the phone. It looks like there's a contact already with this email address that exists, and it's gonna link me to that contact record. So it's trying to or it's it's restricting us, not even just encouraging us, to not be able to create this record. Because two contact records in the Hubspot CRM cannot have the exact same email address. One email address is one person. One contact record can have a primary email address, but also a secondary email address.

Danielle Velt
So just keep that in mind. One contact can have two email addresses. One would be primary, one would be secondary. But one email address can only tie to one contact. So I am actually going to enter a different email address here. Let's see if I can get this one.

Danielle Velt
I'm going to just create a testing one for us.

Danielle Velt
So what what this sidebar is doing is it's asking me to enter certain fields of information to be able to create my contact. So I'm going to, add an email address here, a first name and a last name because remember this is an individual person. Hubspot is automatically going to set me as the contact owner, but I can choose to change that if I need to, so this is a default in Hubspot, but you can change the contact owner before or after you create this record, and then there will be some other options of information to fill out as well, such as job title, phone number, their life cycle stage. We can leave that as lead, and then lead status if you need to fill any of these out.

Danielle Velt
But I can hit create, and it's going to automatically bring me right into this contact record. So there's not gonna be very much information immediately on this contact record because I just created them fresh, and I didn't have too too much information about them to begin with. But now I can see there's a lot of different information here on this contact record. I'm gonna bring us back to the contact's homepage. We're gonna deep dive more into actual records a little bit later. I wanna just bring us back out for now, though. We're gonna talk now about searching for different contacts. So, we know about the global search up in the top left, but you also have a search bar right here, and this is specific to your contact records.

Danielle Velt
So if I search for my name again right here, it is just pulling up contact records, whereas the global search up at the top is pulling up all different types of records that match the characters that I've entered. So this is very contact specific, but this is how I can search for a contact. I can search by their name or their email address to try and find them, to try and find who I want to select here. Because remember, each of these rows that I see here are different individual contact records that fall under that larger object that is called a contact in Hubspot.

Danielle Velt
I can also search in different ways. So let's say I'm not looking for one very specific contact immediately. I can do what's called filtering the information that I see in front of me here. So let's say I just want to see based on some of the the quick filters that I see up here. Maybe I just want to see records where I am the contact owner. Right? Because we do have an owner for every single contact in the system. Some of them can be unassigned, but that's still technically a type of ownership. It can be unassigned or it can be assigned to somebody that is a user in the system. So now that I filtered for contact owner, you'll see this gray box around what I just filtered to tell me that, hey.

Danielle Velt
This filter is currently applied, and you can actually see it's telling me there's only a total of 3 contacts now because I filtered for myself, and if I click on the x here, it's gonna undo all of that, bring me back to no filters, and look at how the contact count changes. I'm gonna refilter for myself here. So, again, it's giving me a different set of information based on what based on how I'm filtering here. I can also choose to filter on create date, for example. So if I want to see all of the contacts that I own that were created, let's say, this month. Right? So it just filtered me from 3 to two. So it's giving me a little bit more fresh information.

Danielle Velt
I could go even further and filter for something like last activity date. The last activity date, when it comes to our individual people here, these contacts, it is the the last activity date is going to be stamped based on the last time you completed an activity for that contact. Meaning, you made a call, you sent an email to them, you completed a task for them, you left a note, etcetera. So I could filter this down even more, let's say, this week so far, and now I only have one contact here. So, again, I'm able to add more filters to get really specific on my contact list that I want to see here. You can also add more of these quick filters by clicking on the more button in the center of this page.

Danielle Velt
So if I wanted to see, for example, next activity date, that's just adding it as another quick filter option. So I haven't yet filtered. I'm just bringing that field to the surface here to be able to filter by it, and everything that I'm doing here is only affecting my user and my view right now. So you don't have to be concerned about changing anybody else's view when you're looking at and making these modifications here. I can also, at any point in time, choose to clear all, and it's gonna bring me back to looking at all of my contacts. Similarly to how we can add those quick filters using the more button, I can click on advanced filters, and what that's going to do is bring out this sidebar on the right, and I can click on add filter, and it's gonna give me the same option that I just saw.

Danielle Velt
So I can add, I'm just gonna pick a randomized field here just to be able to show what this looks like. I can add a filter right here. Let's say status is any of active. So right now, there aren't any contacts that meet that criteria, but I'm still actively setting a filter here. There is no difference between a quick filter and an advanced filter in what it's actually doing. It's all just filtering. But when you add a quick filter, it's just a little bit easier to see exactly what you're filtered for, and it's at the forefront instead of being tucked away in this advanced filter sidebar. That is the only difference between everything that I have done between quick filters and advanced filters here, and with advanced filters, I can also choose to do what's called and criteria or or criteria.

Danielle Velt
So if I want to see let's actually use these quick filters as an example. I can still add them here as advanced filters. So maybe I wanna see contact owner, is any of me, or so I can click add filter group right here or create date. So I can search for the field I want, click on it, and say, is this month. Because when I add filters up top here with the quick filters, there's an implied and between those two criteria that I'm setting here or the filters that I'm setting up here. With advanced filters, we're we are able to be a bit more advanced because we can essentially treat it like, okay, as long as either the contact owner is me or you know what?

Danielle Velt
The contact owner doesn't have to be me, but the create date should be this month. Right? So you can see again, look at the contact account and all of the contacts that I'm seeing in front of me. There's a little bit of a difference there. But if I were to just add another filter right here underneath where it says and in group one or under and in group two, that is acting the same as adding quick filters up here all at the same time. Alright. I'm gonna pause here for a second because I know filtering is something new that we have not discussed yet. Is there any any big questions that we wanna ask right now?

Anastasia Zhukova
Danny, I think, there's a just kind of a know the question, in chat here on how to save those filter views, but I'm sure that you're that's probably the next the next step that you're gonna be covering. Right?

Danielle Velt
Yes. Yep. Just wanted to make sure there was nothing about how to add filters at this point. Okay. Perfect. So.

Ryan Lewin
Awesome So we we can we, like, create best practices for the sales reps and which views we want them to have? I mean, is that something that is would be in scope? Am I following along correctly? Because, like, having all contacts or unassigned contacts is, like, their primary tabs on this page is you know, I'm I'm guessing we would probably remove those or coach the sales reps to remove those and and add some best practice views for prospecting. Right? So I just wanna make. I just wanna make sure I'm following along. One of the things that we've discussed too on this is, like, obviously, the my contacts, but then like, Tim, Isaacs, I have looked through, like, even how to set up these filters in the columns.

Ryan Lewin
So name, email, phone number, lead status, create date. You can adjust those columns so you can get a specific view that you want, and you can make it to the whole company, and then they can adjust however they see fit. So it has been in scope in terms of how to design that specifically. Does that answer your question? Yeah. No. But, I mean, yeah, I I don't wanna break up the flow here. I'm just trying to think long term and how it's best used for a sales rep.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Absolutely. Yep. That's what we're gonna talk about next actually is how do we see the views that have already been created for reps. How do we view the Hubspot default, views that we see up here, and also how do we edit those columns and create new views. Yep. That's what we're gonna talk about next here. So as you probably already saw, so I've been just kind of demoing filtering in general based on all contacts in the system. But Hubspot does also have a my contact section and unassigned contacts view right here, so these two tabs, and what you'll notice is when you click on these views, you can see what the filter is. So we have unassigned contacts.

Danielle Velt
This just means contact owner is unassigned, and my contacts is just contact owner is me. So these are the Hubspot defaults. I can also click on the plus button here and either create a new view or add a view. So if I click on add a view, it's going to show me all of the Hubspot provided ones up at the top here. So again, these are just defaults and you can choose to explore those. Admin promoted is just pulling directly from the Hubspot provided, so it's those top 3 that are already up here when you start out in Hubspot, and then if you've created any views yourself, you'll see those underneath created by me, and then you can also see created by others.

Danielle Velt
So if I wanted to see dial pad contacts, for example, or my active leads. So those are different views that I can pull up and say, I can select my active leads, click add, and now I can see this particular view, and you'll be able to see right away if there are any filters applied too. So I can click on add another view. Maybe I do want to see dial pad contacts, click add, and I can see over here under the filter button.

Danielle Velt
I can choose to clear all filters if I wanted to, if there is a view that someone else owns and you make modifications to it and save that, that will alter that view for everyone. So just be aware of that. Gonna access out of these two. I didn't save any changes there. What I want to.

Ashley Marie Suski
Yeah. We have a question in the chat really quick. Because the view some of them do they have to have a unique name for it to save, or will it let you duplicate the same name?

Danielle Velt
That is a good question. I would need to triple check that just by testing it. For example, so if I did Dialpad contacts let's create a table view.

Danielle Velt
Just wanna make sure. Is it gonna let me do this? Okay. So it looks like it is actually letting me do that. So created by me, Dialpad contacts, and then there is a separate one still. So yes. Okay. It will let us create views with the same names across users. So as one user, you could create two that have the same name or across users, you could end up having, two with the same name. Great question. We do wanna be cognizant of that. Okay. I am gonna go back to this my contacts view just for demo purposes, and what I'm gonna talk about next is actually how to, create and add filters to a new view. So there's a couple ways that I can do this.

Danielle Velt
Let's say I'm on my contacts right now, and I also do wanna filter by create date. So I'll say this month. What I can do is on the right hand side, way over here under add contacts, I can click on clone view. So that's making a copy of this view with my additional filter here. So it went from my contacts. I adjusted some filters there, and now I can rename this new view, and this is so I can say these are my recently created contacts. Right? So now that's another view that I've created, and this could be just for me, or I could choose to share it. So if I click on the 3 dots here right next to the x, I can either rename this view at any time.

Danielle Velt
I can clone it and then create new filters and save. I can delete this view at any time or I can manage sharing. So if I manage sharing, it will likely be shared with everyone by default. But if you are on a specific team in Hubspot, you can choose to just share it with your team or make it private to just your users. So there's different levels of access to these different saved views.

Danielle Velt
Alright. The other thing I can do here is just click on that plus button, do what I did a second ago, which is create new view, and you can choose different visualizations. So Hubspot does have the table view, which is what we've been looking at. It's essentially the list of individual contact records, or I could do a board view, a report view, or a calendar view. Just for simplicity's sake right now, we're gonna stick with table for the the type of view here. But I can create the new view in this way, and I'm gonna say my recent activity contacts. So. I'm gonna click that checkbox, and now I can set my filters. So you can either set the filters and then clone the view to be able to create that new view with those new filters, or we can create the view first and then add our filters later.

Danielle Velt
So if I filter again for contact owner, but then let's say I just wanna do last activity date for this one is this week, and then I would just click save on the right hand side. So you know that you're fully saved on your view if you can't save it and it's grayed out. But if you do see the ability to save, that means you haven't saved your changes yet. So you just wanna make sure you do that before you navigate away from this page. Alright. We're gonna talk a little bit about a couple of things that we see up here. So edit columns is another thing that I know someone mentioned a question about, and you were ahead of me, which is great.

Danielle Velt
So we're gonna talk about edit edit columns. There's a couple different ways to edit the columns that we see here in this table view. Right? Because you may not be immediately seeing all of the properties or fields that you wanna see about these contacts. So I am inherently gonna see the name and the email address, and then likely the phone number, contact owner, primary company, etcetera. At any point in time, I can actually choose to drag and drop these elsewhere in the lineup. So let's say I want to grab phone numbers, so I'll click, on the left hand side of this little block for phone number, drag it over to the right. So it's going to essentially switch with contact owner because I dragged it over.

Danielle Velt
I could move primary company up, and then it's gonna push these two back. Right? So it's really nice that it's very easy if you just need to drag and drop and just change the order of these different fields. But the other way that we can edit these columns is by clicking on this edit columns button right next to where it says view type table view. So I'll click on edit columns, and right away, you're gonna see two sides to this pop up. On the left, you can search for different columns. So if I wanted to see my contact as it associates to its company record, I could add that. So maybe I actually do wanna see that because it's right in front of me and it reminded me.

Danielle Velt
But then there's all different contact properties or contact fields that I can add to my view as well, and they're actually broken out by different property groups, so that's just one thing you'll notice as well. So there's a contact activity property group and lots of properties within that. Lots of different information. But if I know what I'm looking for, then I can choose to just add that, by searching for it. So maybe I want to see next activity date so I can check the box next to where it says next activity date on the left here, and then on the right hand side, this is where everything that I've just added will show up right at the bottom by default, and I can choose to drag it up from right here.

Danielle Velt
So maybe I want last activity date and next activity date right next to each other. Maybe I don't want phone number, I can click the x on the right hand side here. So that gets rid of it from my view, and maybe I actually don't want marketing contact status, and I don't want lead status right now. So I can remove those, and I can also choose to move anything to the top. So if I wanna move contact to company association to the top, great. It's all the way at the top now. So when I'm satisfied with what I see here, I can click on apply in the bottom left, and now that's adjusted how I see these contact records and the information that I'm seeing, and at any time, let's say, you know, the the name of this contact is getting cut off and I don't really like that.

Danielle Velt
I want to click in between these two, these two columns and I'm gonna drag it out so that I can see this information a little bit easier. Right? Maybe it's a little distracting. Maybe you're type a like me. Alright. I'm gonna pause here. If we have any questions on what we just saw with saving views and adding filters and editing those columns of what we're seeing on this contacts home page. Any big questions?

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. Yeah. Had AIA quick one.

Curtis Tate
Say we are creating a customizable view, and I don't know if this is an aptitude question or a traffic's admin question. But when we are selecting that feature for visibility to my team, in my instance as a DOS, would that only be giving visibility to the sales reps on my team, or would that also be providing visibility to the AMs in case that's ever needed? How will that be classified? Curtis.

Ashley Marie Suski
I wrote that down because I would love to know, and I'm gonna find out for us later. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. So no. That is a great question. So if you say my team, it should just be I I'm fairly certain it is just your primary team. It depends on how the the teams are structured in the Hubspot instance that we're looking at. So for example, if we had sales team a and sales team b, and you sit on sales team a, you'd be sharing with that team. I would need to triple check, and Ashley, we can follow up with you on this. I would need to triple check, and Anna, you can correct me if you know off the top of your head, if a team higher up in the hierarchy changes that visibility. I believe it does, but I'll I'll leave that as a a point of follow up for us just to make sure.

Danielle Velt
Because when we have larger sales organizations, you know, we may have sales management team, and then beneath that, team a and sales team b, and so if on, the sales management team, you say share with my team, is that then visible to both sales team a and sales team b? I would just need to follow up on that for everyone to give you the most up to date information.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Can we also, could you go over how to delete, like, your saved searches or your views? Yeah. Absolutely. So let's say, yes, I maybe I don't need this view long term, so I just wanted to use it for today, this my recent activity contacts. So I can click on there's these 3 little dots here next to the x button. I can click on delete right from here, and it's just gonna say, are you sure that you want to delete this view? Right? You can recreate it at any time, but we just wanna make sure that that's what we wanna do. So now it's gonna tell me I've deleted that view for you, and if I go back here to add a new view, you should not see it underneath the created by me any longer. So I created this one and this one a few minutes ago, and I don't see the one that I just deleted any longer.

Danielle Velt
Alright. One other important thing that I wanna call out is being able to sort your data. So I'm actually gonna come back to all contacts really quick. So next to the edit columns and filter button up here, we can also sort data by a particular property. So let's say you don't necessarily want to filter, but you just wanna sort, or you can also filter and sort at the same time. So just to show with a large sample set of data, that's why I'm looking at all contacts right now. Maybe I do want to sort by last activity date so I can search for that property or that field right here, choose last activity date, and then choose most recent or oldest.

Danielle Velt
So you can see on the right hand side over here, that's where this property currently lives, and maybe it it's probably most relevant for me to look at what is the most recent activity date here, or the reverse of that if I'm looking to see, okay, what contacts, have my team not followed up with very recently at all. So sorting is gonna be very helpful whether whether or not you're looking at a saved view. It will be very helpful so you can just pare down that data even further.

Danielle Velt
Alright. The other important thing to note is you can make inline edits from this table view, which is really nice. So if I know an email address that I want to enter for a particular contact and they're on my list here, I can just inline edit that. You could also inline edit existing values here for these different properties. So just be careful of that if you are going in to make inline edits for some of these properties. Something like last activity date, I'll just give a call out here, you won't be able to make an inline edit to this because Hubspot automatically calculates certain things such as last activity date. So, again, just be aware of that. Anything that is editable for your user, you will see as you should see as editable in line here.

Danielle Velt
Oh, I actually just saw sorry. I just happened to see the most recent question in the chat. You do not have to click save when you make those inline edits or you should not have to, and I actually wanna demo that real quick for us. So this is my demo contact. Let's say I'm gonna enter the phone number right here or oops. Hold on one second.

Danielle Velt
Or actually so sorry. Clarification point here. So for something like a phone number, yes. But, for example, if I make the contact owner someone else, there was no save button, or if it is status, for example. So there is, you do need to enter text or enter the drop down value or whatever that may be. But in most cases, I think phone number was not a great example there, so apologies. With phone number, yes, we are technically clicking a save button. But with something like a drop down, you're just choosing that new value, or if it's text, you should just be able to type in the text. Alright. Perfect. Do we have any other questions before I I'm gonna shift us over into the sales workspace to take a deeper look at companies here.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So we are going to do one of two things here to get to the sales workspace. Remember, we have our bookmarks. So if I haven't bookmarked the sales workspace yet, I can click on the funnel icon in the left sidebar navigation to get to the sales workspace, or if I've already bookmarked it up at the top, go to the sales workspace from right there. So we're gonna be, again, diving a lot deeper into the sales workspace as we continue to go on in our sessions here. But we are gonna talk about companies. So the same, the same actions that we just talked about with companies or excuse me, with contacts. But remember that a company is an organization.

Danielle Velt
Right? The organization could have multiple contacts associated with them, and those contacts are individual people. So we're gonna focus later on the summary page, but we are gonna click on the company's page right here. One other thing I would like to call out before we talk more about this is that if I go back to the CRM section in our navigation and click on companies from here, technically, that will bring us to the company's homepage that does not live directly inside of the sales workspace. But what you're seeing here in the sales workspace is effectively the same exact view. So it's just making it easier for our sales reps to not have to click back and forth, between, in this case, their companies and their deals.

Danielle Velt
It all just lives very easily in the sales workspace. So you can actually still follow along or you should be able to follow along with all of this if you're looking at the company's tab in the sales workspace or the CRM tab companies right here. Alright. But we just did all the heavy lifting with contacts because this user interface that you see right in front of you is very, similar. Right? You're gonna see the same search bar up here. So you can search for a company by company name or by its domain. So for example, yesterday, I had my demo company right here. So I can search actively for that company name or its domain, and I'm gonna see different search results come up, and I can select the record that way.

Danielle Velt
I can also use those quick filters again. Right? So Hubspot surfaces some default quick filters for you. Again, company owner, contact owner, those are really, really helpful if you're just looking for your own records, or as mentioned before, we had all comp we had, excuse me, all contacts and my contacts. We have all companies and my companies right here. So that has the same sort of filter. It's just filtering automatically for me as the company owner, and then it's gonna give us, again, similar options here for quick filters, but maybe I want to add another one for status. Right? Because I'm not using lead status on the company level. I'm just using status, and I want to see every, company record that I have that is in prospect discovery, for example.

Danielle Velt
Right? So this company record actually is in prospect discovery, which is great. But if I were to change that, maybe I'm looking at prospects for credit check. I don't have any personally, right, because I'm still filtered as company owner. But I could delete that filter and keep my status filter, and maybe the data will change. It's not guaranteed, but it might change, and I can undo that filter or click the x to undo the filter at any time.

Danielle Velt
And then we have the same option of advanced filters as well. So remember, we can click on add filter and then choose a specific property, customize what exactly we're looking for here. Last contacted maybe is yesterday, and then remember, the big difference the only real difference here between our quick filters and the advanced filters is that our advanced filters allow us to say this or that instead of this and that. So I can say, last contacted is yesterday, or maybe let's do, the same exact property, and I can say, or last contacted is last week. Because I'm looking for two very specific time frames, and I want both of them to show up here in my search results.

Danielle Velt
Same as what we saw before, we have the ability to view companies in the table, board, report, or calendar view. More often than not, you might find that table view to be most helpful, and when we talk about deals starting tomorrow, we'll look at the board view a little bit more specifically because that will be really helpful for deals. We can also edit those columns again. So this button towards the center here. Remember, we have a pop up. We have two sides here. We have the side on the left where we can search for the columns that we're looking for. So maybe I want to make sure that status is here. Okay. Great. So status is here. Maybe I also need Zoom info enrich status, so I'm gonna check that box. But I don't currently need to see city, country, region. I don't need to see several of these.

Danielle Velt
So I can x those out on the right. I can choose to push a couple of these to the top.

Danielle Velt
And one other thing I do wanna call out here that we can do both on the contact and company level is you can freeze columns. So if I choose freeze columns one, that means that I'm freezing the company name. So as I scroll to the right to see all the rest of the information, it's gonna continue to show me that company name, or I could choose to freeze up to two, so that's showing me these two and everything else will move to the right. So if I click apply, let's show what this looks like. These two columns are frozen, and I can scroll this way and see the rest of the information. So that will probably be very helpful at least for seeing contact names and company names as you, navigate through and look for the information that you need to see here.

Danielle Velt
Again, we can also sort. The biggest difference between our contacts and our companies here because, again, we just learned all of this. We already did all the hard work of understanding this user interface on the contact level, and now we're just looking at it on the company level. The big difference here is that with contacts, you're filtering for and looking at information that is specific to the contact. So those are called contact properties and contact fields. On the company level, we're looking at this as company properties and company fields. Right? So just remember that that that status that I was looking at before. Right? This status is specific to the company record versus when I'm looking at the contact, I'm looking at contact information, information that is just on that contact record.

Danielle Velt
And we saw this before with contacts, but if I click on the add companies button up in the top right, I can click on create new, and it's going to ask me to enter two things to start, the company domain name and the company name. So let's just give this as an example. So I can enter company domain name and gonna do a 8 demo. So now I can click on create now that I've entered that information, and it's gonna bring me right into this company record.

Danielle Velt
So I have a new company record here, and again, this looks very similar to the record that I just saw on the contact level. Right? We were looking at an individual contact record before, and it didn't have too too much information filled out, and we're seeing a similar thing here because we have yet to populate this company record with data. Right? If there's information coming from an external source like Netsuite, or enrichment data that's gonna come in, all of that is to come and it will populate on this company record for you, and as time goes on, what you'll see as well, and this is on both the contact and company record level, you'll always see this Breeze record summary up in the top right.

Danielle Velt
So, again, this is Hubspot's AI trying to proactively help you out on these different records. So it'll tell you, hey. Based on everything on this particular record, whether it's contact company and deal, etcetera, it's going to analyze all of the different activities, the details, the property values that are on this record, and try to give you a summary of what has happened throughout the course of time with this record. So for records that we've had in the system for months or years, it'll be really powerful to understand that history in the Breeze record summary.

Ashley Marie Suski
Who answered the question in the chat, Dan? When reps create new companies, does it check D and B or another source? Can you tell us what specifically Hubspot pulls from to get the data that they get about your companies? I was gonna say, Anna, if you wanna help me take that one.

Anastasia Zhukova
Yes. So for companies, as soon as you enter domain so if. Danny tries to go in and create a company with a com domain name, it will flag it that there is another company in Hubspot that already has that domain. You can go in you can go ahead and create one. If it's a branch, if you know that, you know, it's not the same company, you can go ahead and create that. We do have a separate process for DNB and kind of duplication record that we have in place, and I believe we do cover that in in the future in the future steps. It's a little bit more complicated than kind of a recap of 30 seconds.

Anastasia Zhukova
But native functionality in Hubspot, when you try to create a company, when you enter the main name, it will flag it for you right away that there is already another company with the same domain, and you can, you know, choose to click on that company and work with the existing one or override it because it might be a branch or some other situation where you do need a separate company.

Anastasia Zhukova
Does that does that answer the question?

Anastasia Zhukova
Awesome. Alright. Thanks, Anna.

Danielle Velt
I know we only have about 7 minutes left. I wanna give us space. I we we did cover everything we wanted to cover today in this session. I want to make sure that we can answer any q and a in our last few minutes here.

Danielle Velt
If there's anything in the chat that we wanna try to take on or if anyone yep. Curtis, I see your hand raised.

Curtis Tate
If, wanting to do an export, right, to kind of repurpose some of this data from the customizable views, are only admins going to have the right to export, or is that a function all sales reps will have?

Curtis Tate
That is a great question. I may need to defer to Anna and Ashley because I can speak more to the technical.

Danielle Velt
How somebody gets the permissions to export. But, yeah, Anna, if you wanna take that one. Let me validate that.

Anastasia Zhukova
Who has a it it is definitely a permission set that we can, you know, enable or disable, but, let me validate who will have permissions to to export data, and I was just looking at that, like, an hour ago, and I believe it's defaulted off for everybody. I think we need to internally discuss how we actually wanna treat that. Great question, Curtis. Thanks for bringing it up.

Jeremy Schlachet
We.

Ashley Marie Suski
Have another question in the chat. Will we have any safeguards to block reps purposely creating duplicates? Francis, if they try to create a duplicate with that domain, it is going to flag it. I think maybe you're thinking of what if I put a different domain but the same name. Yes. So I just for example, I went for the first one on the top of the list or one of them, Bob Dylan, and I searched, and it does say, gosh. That looks familiar. Did you mean Bob Dylan, and it shows existing ones.

Francis Coderre
But I think I think Anna mentioned that we can create it. Right? You can still create a new one. So if someone's intentionally creating duplicates, which unfortunately happens sometimes, could you know? Yeah. But there's there's.

Jeremy Schlachet
I'm testing something. So walk that. I just entered the Bob Dylan one because I'm testing. So it does say, though, when you open it and try to enter Bob Dylan, it says guster. You can see guster fish. If you enter one, it says flat out that it already exists, and you can click on that file. So if someone's recreating it, I wonder can can Hubspot or someone send us an email to say, hey. A warning went out. Someone still created that duplicate. Can we look into this? Because I think that would stop a lot of bad behaviors.

Francis Coderre
Yeah. That's what I'm getting at, and I just created a Bob Dylan duplicate. I didn't mean to click it, but I did, and it worked. So so I can circumvent that kind of nice warning if they wanna maliciously create duplicates. Right?

Ashley Marie Suski
Yes, and one thing that we currently we want the domain to be we want it to block it completely, but right now, we cannot have it block it completely because we do have duplicate domains in the system. So we need to sort ours out first before we can put that as, like, a full on blocker, and then someone would have to reach out to CRM support to create it. That's how I envision it working, as soon as we Really? Francis is look in. I think Francis has called those. Sorry.

Jeremy Schlachet
I think Francis is legit because I'm looking, and now there's two identical companies entered in with two separate owners, and so, Danielle, is there a way that we can get some type of alert when that happens that someone overrided the the duplicate?

Ashley Marie Suski
We can talk about that later. Yeah.

Jeremy Schlachet
And I was gonna say, yeah, this afternoon. I think that's a perfect thing for us to jot down and and submit through the form.

Hannah Peth
Is it only flagging it if, the domain matches? Because I created an account or a company, without putting a domain name in.

Ashley Marie Suski
Right. Because I can't make that mandatory at this moment because not all of the companies that we have in there have a domain. So we're still working on a lot of data things.

Hannah Peth
Okay. So that will be mandatory.

Ashley Marie Suski
Launch. Yeah.

Hannah Peth
Okay.

Danielle Velt
Alright.

Tony Pomocnik
Any other questions right now or from the chat that we want to address in our last few minutes here.

Danielle Velt
I don't have anything on my side.

Anastasia Zhukova
Oh, I see something popping up. Okay. I think we're I think we're good. If anybody on the traffic side has any other questions, please raise your hand right now, or we we will regroup again tomorrow, you have an another chance for questions. I would love it if we all feel like experts in in this area so far. But, yeah, we'll give everybody a second.

Ashley Marie Suski
This was a great overview, and team, we meet in about an hour. If you would like to join us, you can ask questions, give ideas. We can brainstorm workshop stuff that you would like to see in Hubspot. You can do your prework postwork with us. We will have that opportunity in about an hour internally.

Ashley Marie Suski
Yeah, and the post work for session two will be posted here shortly.

Ashley Marie Suski
Thank you, Anna. Thank you, Danny.

Danielle Velt
Thank you. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Hey. I took that as a note later that we gotta review that with them, Augie. We still got a notator in here notetaker in here, so we're still being, transmitted.

Anastasia Zhukova
No. No worries. Yeah. No. Listen. I agree. I've got, I think, in general.

Michelle Carranza
Hey, everyone.

Michelle Carranza
Hello. How is that? How is everyone doing today? Excellent. Awesome. It's good to hear it. Entirely too much silence here for a bunch of Traffix employees.

Will Shetka
You want you want me to stir the pot?

Ashley Marie Suski
Yes. The pot. Stir the pot. We're.

Will Shetka
Having a debate over here about whether it's easier to parent boys or girls.

Michelle Carranza
Oh.

Ashley Marie Suski
Well, as the mother of 3 Girls. Feral males, I would love to hear all of your opinions.

Michelle Carranza
Hands down, girls. Girls, I.

Tony Pomocnik
Have I have one of each, and it is easier to parent girls between the ages of firstborn to 11, and then after 11, it is much harder to parent a girl than it is a boy. Agree. With you, Tony. All the way.

Will Shetka
Good answer, Tony. That was that was that was exactly what we decided, Tony. If if that's getting full approval by this group, that's exactly what we said. The same thing.

Tony Pomocnik
Preteen through teenage girl is not anything to mess with. So.

Ashley Marie Suski
And I'm also the oldest of 4 girls, and there's 10 years between me and my youngest. So my parents had at least one teenage girl for her very, very long time.

Michelle Carranza
Your poor parents.

Michelle Carranza
I believe.

Ashley Marie Suski
We have our hostess with the mostest. I see Danny. I think I saw Anna jump in. I just want to remind everyone to drop questions in the chat. If you are the kind of person that does not do well with following along live, please feel free to just tune in and watch and then practice afterwards. Don't distract yourself any more than you need to during this training. Again, Danny and Anna are working us through how the system works, not necessarily how Trafix is going to process the system. If So you have any questions like that, you can save that for later or drop them in the chat, and we will get them answered for you.

Ashley Marie Suski
Awesome.

Danielle Velt
Thanks, Ashley. Great to see everybody again. Ashley, wanted to actually just make one call out for the group here and just get your quick thumbs up approval. So we'd like to plan to have everyone continuing to follow along using the production environment for this training session today just to continue ensuring consistency across training sessions and the most up to date configuration inside of Hubspot. Today, we're gonna be talking a lot about creating different activities, and what we wanna do is just make sure that everybody is equipped with how to set up the correct test record for themselves with their own email address so that they can really easily complete those homework items while not actually sending an email to a real contact, if that all sounds alright.

Ashley Marie Suski
That sounds wonderful. If you have issues with any of your permissions or anything like that, just let us know.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. Yep. So at the end of training today, we are gonna talk about how everybody can set themselves up to complete homework, which is creating these different activities that we're gonna be talking about today. One other call out, and this is regarding our dial pad calling functionality as it integrates with Hubspot. It's still a work in progress as far as getting it working in production. So making calls in Hubspot using Dialpad is going to be covered in one of our future sessions next week just so that we're able to fully demo that calling functionality. So calling is the only activity type that we're not going to be covering today, and I'm gonna make sure that we can slot that in and circle back to it next week during our time.

Danielle Velt
Alright. But as we know, today's introduction to discovery. So we're gonna be talking about adding sales activities, creating tasks, scheduling sequences, and we'll talk about what Hubspot calls a sequence since that's a Hubspot term. We'll talk about sending one to one emails, scheduling meetings, actually working your task list, and viewing your sales activities, and preparing for portfolio check in. As always, we're gonna be doing this demo style. So we're gonna be demoing in production. So I'm gonna get my screen teed up for us. Alright. Should be seeing my screen. We're still seeing exactly what we've been seeing the last couple of days. We have this dashboard section as my home page here and specifically the sample data dashboard as my default.

Danielle Velt
You should be seeing the same thing if you haven't been changing that up on your side and your view, and what I want to actually start us off with here is just a very, very quick, not as not as in depth as the last couple of days, quick sidebar navigation review and new terminology review just one more time just to recenter ourselves. So the left sidebar navigation. If we remember, we have a bookmark section up at the top here. So remember that as we go along, we're gonna be talking about very specific tools, hyper specific tools for sales, and I wanna make sure that everybody knows that they can bookmark these things. It makes it so much easier to get to them later.

Danielle Velt
So if you click on about halfway down the navigation, this is our little sales funnel icon. This is where you can find the sales workspace. So please please please add that to your bookmarks if it's not already. Right? You can see add or remove from your bookmarks. Just be aware, again, this is kind of in real time I'm showing you. If you remove a bookmark and then re add it, it's always going to be re added right to the bottom there so you can kinda change the order of what you see from top to bottom in your bookmarks, and then our CRM little booklet icon up at the top here, this is where we can find contacts, companies, and deals.

Danielle Velt
So please make sure to bookmark those as well. Makes it a lot easier to get to those things, and just a quick terminology recap. So we've talked about objects and records before. So let's remember, we come over to contacts. So in our CRM, we need objects and records to keep track of all these different customer relationships. Remember that an object is the type of data that represents a business relationship or a process. So contacts in general, that's an object. Companies in general, that is an object. A record is a single entity or file within the Hubspot CRM that holds information about that specific entity, such as an individual contact, an individual company, or an individual deal. So each of these different rows that I see here, these are individual records that I can click into an action, and those contacts that we're seeing right in front of us right now, these are the individual human beings that we talk to, so this is gonna be a big part of today talking about and going into these records, talking about sending one to one emails, scheduling a meeting with these contacts, and also, you know, actually leaving notes, setting up tasks for ourselves on these records, and also on company records.

Danielle Velt
So companies are those business entities, and they can be thought of as that parent record that holds all the people. Right? So I can get to my contacts if I click right here up in the top left. I can get from contacts to companies from right here or use my sidebar navigation, whether it's already in my bookmarks or just down in the CRM section to get to companies from here, and remember, we're gonna be talking more about deals tomorrow, but a deal is a potential sale with a dollar amount attached. Remember, we look at our deals right here, this is where we track the revenue pipeline and deal progression through stages inside of a deal pipeline. Alright, and with that, we are going to hop right back over to contacts.

Danielle Velt
So I'm actually gonna do this. I'm gonna go back to contacts from my bookmark section here. So I'm going to bookmarks in the top left, and I'm gonna click on contacts, and I am going to continue using my demo record that we've been seeing in the last couple of days. This is our aptitude 8 contact record. So I'm gonna search for them in the search bar, click on them, and that brings me right into this contact record. So again, we're gonna be spending a lot more time actually looking at what is in front of us on this left side panel, the middle panel, and the right panel today. So on the left hand side, we're gonna see a few things here.

Danielle Velt
The first thing I actually wanna call out, and this is part of our demo that we're gonna get to, very shortly here, is if a contact is inside of a sequence, you are going to be able to see that front and center in the top left of their contact record, which is really helpful, and you can either pause or unenroll that sequence. We're gonna look even more deeply at sequences later on, but just for a quick terminology update here. So a Hubspot sequence is a series of automated one to one emails and automated tasks that can get assigned to you. So for example, let's say, this is just a basic example of how you could implement a sequence or why you'd want to use a sequence in Hubspot.

Danielle Velt
It's intended to be a time saver for a sales rep. So let's say you actually go out to an event somewhere, you collect different prospects from that event, and you enter them into Hubspot, and you're like, great. This is fantastic. I can follow up with all of these people. I had great conversations with them at this particular event or conference. I can enroll all of those contacts into a sequence that is specifically hyper focused and geared towards event follow up to say, hey. It was great to see you at this event. We talked about x y z, and I wanna follow up and continue that conversation with you. So it's allowing you to send out a one to one email in bulk, but also hyper personalize it at the same time.

Danielle Velt
So a time saver for you so you're not manually going through and doing those things every single day and having to follow up with that person. When if and when they actually reply, the contact will automatically get unenrolled from the sequence so that you can continue on with your conversation with them. Right? So it's not meant to send out automated emails if the person actually replies to you. It's really just automating the follow up process for you up to the point where they are engaged again. So, again, we'll look more closely at this very soon, but just wanna call that out because that is the first thing that we're seeing in the top left here. But normally, if a contact is not enrolled in a sequence, the first thing you're gonna see here is the name of the contact up at the top.

Danielle Velt
I can click on this pencil icon right next to the name of this contact, and I can edit their first name, their last name if I need to, add their job title if I'd like to, and then I will see their email address right here. You can also copy to clipboard their email address that's right here, and I will also see a few different icons right here underneath their email address. This is a lot of what we are talking about today is how do we actually perform these different sales activities. So we have a note icon here. So if I click on create a note, I can leave a note, and you can think of this as an internal note.

Danielle Velt
This note is not going to be visible to the actual contact themselves. Right? The note is completely internal. It's for you and any other teammates, other users in Hubspot to be able to see this note on this record. If somebody in Hubspot has, the ability to see this full record, they should be able to see the note as well. So I can say maybe I actually want to tag Anna because she's my teammate and say, Anna, can you please take a look at this contact's recent activity and let me know your thoughts. So I was able to just type open text here, and one thing that you probably just saw me do as well, I typed the at symbol and then started typing my teammate's name.

Danielle Velt
So once that happens, once I type the at symbol and start typing, I can see all the different users, all my teammates that have a name that might match these letters or part of their name that matches those letters, and I can select them. What this does by selecting that person, it will send them a notification that I've tagged them in this note. It's effectively just tagging somebody in the note, letting them know, hey. I I'm pinging you. I'm sending you a notification because I need some help here or I have a question that is specific to this record. The other thing to note here so at the bottom, you'll see this little bar. You have the ability to format your, text here in the note.

Danielle Velt
You can also insert a link, insert an image, and you can even attach files to notes, which is all really helpful. It also says down here associated with 3 records. So I can choose if I don't want this note to show up on, for example, the company record and the deal record that are associated with my contact here. But by default, Hubspot is going to recognize that all 3 of those records are associated or that the company and the dealer associated with the contact, and so we might want this note on all 3 of those records, have the visibility across all of those records. But if I want to change that at all, I can say I can click on associated with 3 records, and I could deselect these other two because maybe I just want this to show up on the contact record.

Danielle Velt
Just for demo purposes, I'm actually gonna come back in, check the boxes for company and deal, and associate it to all of them. So we'll see it across all 3, and one thing that's really nice here as well is that I can actually do two things at once here. I can log this note to this record, but I can also at the same time create a task for follow up. So Hubspot right here will let me create a task as well as leave my note, and I can choose what type of task I want it to be. If I choose email or call, Hubspot will try to tee you up for those activities when you enter your task queue, and we're gonna look at our task queue a little bit later on in our session here, and you can also customize and choose what the due date should be.

Danielle Velt
Let me collapse that. So there's some preset options here whether it's today, tomorrow, and two, 3 business days, one week, etcetera, or you can just completely choose a custom date, and that will bring up the calendar view for you. So super helpful. I'm gonna set this up for myself. So I'm clicking on create note, and now we're gonna talk more about this middle pane in a second here, but. I'm first gonna come to the activity section because this is where I can see what I just did. So let me just refresh my page.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So now I can see. I'm gonna see a few things in this activities pane, and we'll break this down even further very soon. But what I'm gonna see is what upcoming activities do I have. So is there a meeting scheduled with this contact? Is there a task that's set to be due in the future, and in this case, I still have this contact enrolled in a sequence, so I can see that sequence activity here. I can also see the note that I just left. So that's gonna be logged under December 2025. So this activity section is really important because this is where you can see the full history of everything that's happened with this contact record.

Danielle Velt
So, again, this is the note that I left. But then also, I created a task to follow up at the same time. So, again, nice time efficiency right there. Alright. We're gonna come back to the left sidebar here. I can also create an email. So that's right next to our note button on the left here. If I click on create an email and one thing I need to call out here is that if you have not yet connected your email address right? We talked on day one earlier this week about connecting your email address in your profile and preferences settings. You'll need to do that before you can successfully send a one to one email on a record in Hubspot.

Danielle Velt
So just please note that with an asterisk. But what I can do here is this is my email composer. If I click that I want to send a one to one email, I can now set up my email subject. So I can say maybe this is quick follow up, touch base. It's being sent from my email address. So although the contact's email address and my email address as a user are the same email address, on a real contact, what you're going to see is which contact am I sending to, so this is, again, still my email address, but that's because it is the contact's email address, and this and then the from information is my user's information.

Danielle Velt
So just to make that really easy to understand there, and then I can just compose my email as normal. So I could say, hi, Danny. Just checking in. Right, and then I can load my email signature. If we're using Front for that, you should see that integrated here, and then again, at the bottom, I have all these formatting options. I can insert a link, insert an image. There's all different options of things to insert here, and then you can attach a file, and same as before, we can see, do I want to associate intentionally this email with all of these different records? Do I want this activity to show up on all of these records? Because they're all associated with one another.

Danielle Velt
So I can choose what I need to do there. I can, again, create another follow up task if I want to while also sending this email. So, again, really easy, less buttons to click ultimately. The other thing I can do here is let's say I don't actually want to type this email out myself. Maybe I want to use a template because you can store different templates inside of Hubspot to use for one to one emails. Up at the top here, right underneath where it says email, I can click on templates, and I'm gonna see a pop up here. Please note, might be defaulted to owner is me for templates, and you might see nothing here. Make sure that you click on where it says me and choose any or my teams if applicable.

Danielle Velt
But I would say try to choose any just so you can see all of the different email templates that are at your disposal. So let's say I want to select this follow up email that follows through. So I can hover over that and click select, and now what that's done is it's entered in automatically for me the text that was in this email template. Right? It's trying to standardize this process for us so that if we have a certain type of email that we send very often as a rep, you can load that in and then customize the really brief sections that you need to, right? So I can just take out this portion and just say, I'm calling because. I need to check in with you.

Danielle Velt
And then I can just plug in any dates. Day 12 a, 12PM, and then enter their phone number. Right? So very easy to be able to enter those things and then be able to send this email off. I'm gonna pause here in case we have any bigger questions to address in the chat as we're going through how these different activities work.

Danielle Velt
I see Chris is.

Curtis Tate
Yeah. I have a couple questions here. So when creating that note and say we're adding an employee internally, are they gonna receive a notification in, like, that bell setting? Does it go to their email, or do they have to physically go to the page to see the note?

Danielle Velt
Yeah. That is a great question. I'm actually gonna duplicate this page just so I can stay where we just were, but also show a visual to answer that question. So up in the top right hand corner, if we go over to I'm gonna x this out for us. If we click on our settings gear icon, right, so that's between the bell and the question mark. I'm gonna click on settings gear, and then I'm gonna scroll all the way to the top, and on this left sidebar here, click on notifications. We wanna make sure so that you don't miss any at mentions as Hubspot calls them. We wanna make sure that we have a couple of notifications turned on, and to Curtis' point, we've chosen whatever method of notification we want to, right?

Danielle Velt
The the how you get notified. So I'm gonna scroll down to this what you get notified about section, and the way that I can just make sure that this is enabled already for me is I'm gonna go to this contacts and company section and expand it and then scroll all the way down, and I can choose how I want to get notified. So these bottom two, you're mentioned on a company record and you're mentioned on a contact record are the ones that we need to have enabled. They should be enabled by default, but just in case, I wanna make sure everybody knows how they can customize this. So you can choose if you want to get pop up, browser, bell, or email notifications.

Danielle Velt
You could choose that you want all 4 of these or just one or two or 3 types. You can also choose to get a specific sound or you could turn the sound off when this happens. Right? So it's all based on your preference here in terms of the sound when a notification comes through for this type of notification and what method it comes through. But this is definitely important for if somebody if a teammate at mentions you in a note or logged activity on a contact or company record, and you'll see the same thing underneath deals as well actually. So if you scroll down to deals, it should be the last one here as well if you're mentioned on a deal record.

Danielle Velt
Does that help? I wanna make sure we feel good about that before we move on.

Curtis Tate
Yeah. No. That helps, and I know I had one more question I don't wanna take away from others. But, sequencing, are we gonna be upload I guess this is the traffic's question. Are we gonna be uploading, like, standard templates for sequences, or if we make seek or changes to sequences, is it gonna reflect that for everyone in the organization?

Scott Sears
I I that's a really good call, Curtis. I think one of the other things that we should with that is our templates now that we have in front. Will some of those be carried over as well? But to your point, Curtis, I think we should all work on, like, maybe create a list. Actually, maybe as a takeaway, create a list of some potential formatting or emails that we want to send, and we can we can type it out and have it saved in there.

Augie Picado
So, guys, guys, there's already there's already 4 standard templates that we created with input from a bunch of the sales leaders here on this call. Those are in there. They'll be available for everybody to use as well. So, I mean, that was a starting point. We wanna take baby steps. We talked about having lots of them, and we said, let's start with 4 basic ones. So we will certainly review those with everybody.

Scott Sears
Cool. Thank you. And.

Ashley Marie Suski
When you enroll them in a sequence, it will customize like, you can change for that specific sequence for that person, and it doesn't change it to, like like, the whole sequence. It's just for that specific contact.

Danielle Velt
Yes. That is a great call out. When it comes to using templates for a manual email send, like we're demoing here, and then also in sequences, like Ashley mentioned, when you get to that page of your customizing it, you've already loaded it. That is just customizing it for your contact that you're enrolling or that you're sending the email to, you won't have to worry about accidentally editing the template for everybody or accidentally editing the sequence for everybody. So we'll we'll demo that a little bit more when it comes to sequences shortly here. Alright. I see Will's hand. If it's alright, this will be our last question before we move on.

Will Shetka
Yep. If I have, let's say, 10 contacts at aptitude 8 that I'm reaching out to and the right person responds and they give us all the contacts we need, is there a way that I can cut off all those other sequences with at the company level, or do I have to go through each contact and cut each one of those sequences off?

Danielle Velt
Great question. There is actually a setting within sequences themselves. So this would have to be set at the sequence level. So that's just something I wanna note to the full traffics team. There is a setting at the sequence level where you can say it's literally a toggle. It's fantastic, and it says unenroll automatically all contacts from the same company if one of them replies. So that is very much possible to do.

Landinn Eckhardt
But that's not default. Right? That's you suddenly get to still go in and toggle that. Correct? It's not default to where if someone does reply, it shuts it off?

Danielle Velt
I'm having trouble at the moment remembering if it's the default when you create a new sequence. But when you go into your sequence settings, that option is very easy to enable. It's just a quick toggle. I'll actually be able to show it once we go into sequences. Okay. Sorry. No worries. Alright. Amazing. So just for example sake, since I'm sending this email email to myself, I'm gonna click send or I can actually say send later if I don't wanna send it now. So if I click send later, it's just gonna ask me, when I want to send it. Hubspot tries to tell you what the best time is to send. I would say take that with a grain of salt.

Danielle Velt
It's really just Hubspot's recommendation. You may still want to schedule a very specific time. But I'm actually gonna change this back to send now just for demo sake. Alright, and then like I mentioned before, so we will, move calling to when we can talk more about Dialpad. So, we can forego our calling button here, and we're gonna talk about creating a task. So there's a few different places you can create tasks, but one of them is directly from any record, whether it's a contact, company, or deal. So if I click on create a task, I'm gonna see another pop up here, and I can enter the name of that task. So I'm gonna say follow up with Danny, and I can say when I want this to be due.

Danielle Velt
So, again, we have kind of our preset options here, or you can set a custom date. So maybe I want it to be a very custom date, and I can choose the time as well. I can choose to receive a reminder email from Hubspot, or I can choose no reminder. You can also set a particular task if you'd like it to actually be recurring. You can set it to repeat, and then you can also choose your task type, what is the priority. Queues are more for when teams are sharing tasks. So I typically wouldn't set this, but we can also choose who we want the activity to be assigned to, it should default to you since you're creating it, but you could always assign the activity to someone else as well, and I can leave notes on the task here. So if I need to give myself some more context details, I can do that right here in this notes section on the task, and then I can click create, and so, again, what I'm gonna see now in this center activities pane is that I have a task.

Danielle Velt
I have several different tasks, and I can also see any emails as well. One thing I wanna note as well is you can see all of these different activities broken out, by themselves or on the activity tab in the center pane here. So all activities are here in the center. I can click on just notes, just emails, just calls, just tasks, and just meetings if I want to see them broken out separately, and the last activity here with a quick button is schedule a meeting. So, again, one more quick call out here to be able to schedule a meeting from inside of Hubspot, you need to make sure that your calendar is connected. So, again, going all the way back to day one when we talked about connecting your calendar through your profile and preferences, You just need to do that, and Hubspot should warn you if you haven't done it already.

Danielle Velt
It'll say, hey. You can't schedule a meeting until you've connected your calendar. But now that I've done that, I can say, great. I am the host, and I want this to be a quick sync as my title. This meeting invitation should also be sent to the recipient as a normal meeting invitation. They should not see anything indicating that it's been created from inside of Hubspot. It should just be added to your calendar and to the recipient's calendar, and then I can choose my start date, so maybe it's gonna be this Friday at 3PM, and I can choose a meeting type. Is this an attempt, introduction, discovery, or customer activity? Maybe this is just an introduction. I can also choose a location.

Danielle Velt
Is this a phone call? Is this in person or custom? So if it's virtual, I could put in my virtual link there. But let's just call this in person for now, and then I can also add my attendee description and internal notes. So if I choose to add an attendee description, this is public to the recipient, to the contact. So make sure that this is just where you're putting your normal meeting description that you expect everybody to be able to view. But then you can separately put an internal note. This is just for users in your portal as it says here kind of with this little help text. So it's very similar, if not the same, as leaving a note on the record.

Danielle Velt
Right? The contact cannot see the note. The contact can only see the description for attendees and the title. So I'm gonna put in this is visible to the contact. This is internal visible only. Oops. There we go, and then I can save that, and now I should see that under activity as well under upcoming.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Yep. We can see my meeting right here, and again, that'll translate over to this meetings tab in the center pane here. I can see all these details. If I need to edit these details, I can as well. So at any point, I can come in and click on actions on this meeting activity and click on edit and go in and edit some of these details, and we should be able to do the same thing on these different types of activities. So for a task coming in and if if you see no option to edit here, you'll be able to just edit in line. So for task, it is in line. For meeting, I have to click edit, etcetera.

Danielle Velt
One other thing that we can do that I need to mention here. So this more button. If I click on this more button next to meetings, this is where I can enroll a contact into a sequence. The only thing to note here, and this is why I have this contact enrolled in this sequence right now. Right? Because we see up at the top, it says this contact is already enrolled in a sequence. Hubspot's also gonna tell you right here, hey. This contact is already enrolled in one sequence. One contact can only be enrolled in one sequence at a time. So just be aware of that. I would need to unenroll this contact from the sequence that I have them in right now if I want to then be able to enroll them again later.

Danielle Velt
I can also pause a sequence. So this effectively just stops the email communications and the tasks that are going to you for any reach out. It pauses it until you choose to unpause. So if I click on pause, it'll tell me right here the sequence for this contact won't move to the next step until you resume it, and if the contact replies to you while the sequence is paused, they will be unenrolled automatically. So I could say, great. Pause them. So then you'll see that it says resume, or I could still choose to just unenroll them. If I know that I need to drop them into a different sequence and I'm okay. With, unenrolling them from my current sequence, I can do that.

Danielle Velt
So for example's sake, I'm gonna do unenroll contact, and now we don't see that notice anymore, and now what I should see if I click on more is enrolling sequence, and then I have the option to enroll them into a new sequence. So, again, I'm gonna see the pop up screen here, and again, make sure that it's not showing owner is me. We wanna show owner is any, and then what I can do is select the exact sequence that I want to enroll in. So let's say it's our tenured customer value expansion, and I click select. You're gonna see a few things in front of you. The first being, making sure that your time zone is selected correctly.

Danielle Velt
We then also want to ensure that we know when we want the email cadence to begin. So do I want the first automated email in this email sequence to send now or send later? Right? This is very similar to what we just saw with the manual email send, the send now versus send later. So I could schedule this to be sent on a different day at a very specific time. Right? If I wanted it to look a little more natural and human rather than potentially automated going out at exactly 03:30, for example, and this is where, as I mentioned before, because we had a great question about this, this is where I can really customize how this sequence appears to this contact. Right? So any edits that I make here are not editing the sequence template at large. It's just affecting the way that this contact sees this sequence. So I can choose send later. I can even change the email subject.

Danielle Velt
And I can completely change what's here. If I wanted to delete a sentence and add more text here, I can change how this appears. Right? So it's it's automation and it's a template all in one. So I can see this is how it's going to appear for that contact, and then I can even get as specific as to say, okay. So the sequence template is set up so that after the first email goes out, the second automated email is gonna go out in 6 business days. Maybe for this one contact, I wanna change that, and I want it to go out in 4 business days and maybe at a different time. So I can make those types of changes.

Danielle Velt
The only thing I can't do from here is change what steps are included. So I have to be okay. With the number of steps and what they are here. So just be aware of that. That would be a sequence level change where you'd be changing it for everyone. If you went into the sequences tool and changed the steps themselves. But the timing and the content, you can absolutely change for one individual contact. It will also warn you up at the top if you have any placeholders. Right? So Hubspot lets you put into these different templates placeholders and reminds you, okay. So you need to put in a specific link here before you can start the sequence or you at least need to just remove that placeholder.

Danielle Velt
Right? I had the placeholder there a second ago. I'm gonna command z to undo that, and I can't start my sequence until I it says update missing information for this contact, but what that really means here is that there's a placeholder. So as soon as I get rid of that, I can start the sequence. But I'm still gonna review the rest of this and just make sure it looks good. Maybe I want this task that's gonna get automatically assigned to me to go out 3 days after 3 business days after the second email is sent, and what you're seeing on the left hand side here is that the dates are adjusting. Right? So if I change this date, create task in two business days, great.

Danielle Velt
That changes when this task is going to be assigned to me versus. Friday versus Monday. Because this sequence is only assigning tasks and sending out emails on business days. I can change the task title and change the notes. Again, this is specific for me. This is not changing it at the sequence level, and then this is my last automated email, and I can do all those same customizations, and as soon as everything looks good, I can choose to start the sequence. One other big thing to call out here is I can choose to start at a different step in the sequence. So if I don't actually wanna start at email number one, great. I can start at email number two. So I'm still not changing the whole structure of the sequence. I'm just choosing to drop my contact in at the right step.

Danielle Velt
I'm gonna change that back for myself just to the first automated email, and then I can choose start sequence, and I just wanna make sure that the to email address is correct, so this is the contact. The from email address is me, and the only reason it's letting me select this is because I could have two email addresses connected to my one user in Hubspot. You will you will likely only have one, but just in case you do have two, it will let you choose what email address you want to send from, and then it will also show you how many sequence or or one to one emails you can send. Right? There is a send limit per user.

Danielle Velt
So it's just making sure that you're aware of that send limit for yourself and making sure that you know, okay. Great. I have a lot of sends left. I'm not hitting my limit for this particular month, and then I can click start sequence, and now, again, I can see up here. Great. I'm enrolled into a new sequence. Alright. I'm gonna keep us going here. I'm just keeping an eye on the time. On the left hand side, underneath all of our sales activities, we got through a whole bulk of things here that are related to our homework and creating these different activities. But what I wanna talk about as well is the information that we see about our records on the left sidebar.

Danielle Velt
So underneath those activities, you're going to see a section called about this contact. You're going to see a similar type of section on companies and deals. So there's a lot of information here, and this is a lot of the information that you saw on that contact's home page yesterday. Right? You could make those inline edits. You can edit the columns and the fields that you're seeing. That's what a lot of these are. That's the only way that you could see it as a column and a property or field right here is for those to be connected to one another. Right? So if I'm seeing phone number as a field on that contact's home page that we were looking at yesterday, it's the same field as this phone number field, and I can make edits to any properties that allow me to here.

Danielle Velt
But, again, some of them, you'll just be able to see the details because it's automatically set by Hubspot. So if you need to ever see the property history, you can view that there. A big call out here is that if you are not seeing the field that you need to see on the left sidebar here, you can still see it. We just need to click on the actions button right here in the top right, and then click on view all properties. So a sidebar will pop out, and there will be plenty of fields here to look at. So this is every field that lives on the contact record just in case, again, it's not being surfaced on the left hand side immediately for you. You can always find it and you can dynamically search for that property.

Danielle Velt
Alright, and then at the very bottom for contacts, you will see if they are subscribed to any particular email preferences. Right? Are they subscribed to marketing emails, for example? If Hubspot has captured their cookie data, you will see any website activity that Hubspot's been able to capture for them. Have they been to the website recently, and then any additional information. You can also, for your own view, drag and drop these different sections if it's more helpful to you.

Danielle Velt
In the center pane, I know we've already talked a little bit about activities, but I wanna talk a bit more about this tab. So on this activities tab, always always always make sure that you're filtering the activity. Right? There's a lot of different if I click on this filter activity drop down, there's a lot of different options for the types of activities that I can see here. Right? I can see form submissions from this contact. I can see calls that I've made, emails that I've sent, meetings, notes, and tasks as we just saw. But there's all different types of things here. I can see the sequence activity. I can see life cycle changes, communication subscriptions. Whenever things change or things happen to this contact, they're all showing up here.

Danielle Velt
So I can deselect anything that maybe I don't wanna see right away, and that's gonna change what I see on this record. So if I scroll back up, now I'm only filtered for 10 out of a possible 38 activity types on this record. So it can help you clean up some of the noise if you're not interested in seeing a specific activity type here, and again, when I say filter activity, in this sense, it's talking about a whole plethora of activities, not just the sales activities. Right? The sales activities are primarily under this communication section and team activity section. So I can uncheck all of these that I don't need to see and just keep what I want here, and you can also search for activities too.

Danielle Velt
If you're not finding what you're looking for and you're thinking, I swear, I had a note on this record, previously and I'm trying to find it. Results are based on the terms found in the following field. So Hubspot always reminds us what it's actually searching based on right here, which is great. So it's email subject, task subject, task body, note body, call body, and meeting body. So just keep that in mind. If you're not finding or surfacing what you need to, the keyword that you're searching for has to be in one of those subjects or bodies of those activity types. The other thing you can do, and and this is very helpful for notes in particular. I'm actually gonna go over to my notes section here.

Danielle Velt
Let's say I have a lot of different notes on this record and I really want to make sure this shows up at the top, I can pin it. So if I come back to activity, scroll up to the top, you're gonna see your pinned activities up at the very top, and then any upcoming, and then the historical, right, from December backwards underneath that.

Danielle Velt
Alright, and then on contact and company records, we have what's called the intelligence tab. So this is Hubspot doing a little bit of light data enrichment for us by default. There are further data enrichment tools, but just want you to be aware for right now without taking further action on data enrichment that there will be some basic details for you here based on the email domain of the contact and their associated company, and the last thing I'm gonna call out here before I pause one more time is on the right hand side, we're gonna see that Breeze record summary that was briefly mentioned over the last couple of sessions this week. So it's going to tell me what's been happening on this record, try to summarize it for me, and you can even ask a question.

Danielle Velt
So I can, again, pull out the AI assistant essentially and ask more about this record. You'll see the integration sync with Netsuite and then any associations. Right? So this is what I've been talking about with the contact being associated with a company record and also being associated with the deal record, and you can also drag and drop these for your own view too if you need to change the order in which these appear. Alright. I'm gonna pause here, keeping an eye on the time. Still doing good? How are we feeling? Big questions.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. We're gonna keep on going. So I'm gonna bring us over to our sales workspace now because all the other tools we're gonna be talking about are in the sales workspace. So up at the top, I'm gonna go to the sales workspace from my bookmarks, but remember it's also in the sales hub section under this little funnel icon. So we're gonna head over to the sales workspace. This is where we are going to be tomorrow to talk more about deals, but right now, we're gonna talk a bit more about companies and tasks. So if I click on companies.

Danielle Velt
Remember, we've already looked at this. We looked at this page yesterday. But if I come into my aptitude 8 company record, search for it, and click on it, and remember, you can also from the contact record, as long as the company is associated directly on that right hand sidebar where those associations lived, I could click on the company from there as well, and it would bring me straight into this record. This is where I can do all of those same things. The user interface again, we've now done the heavy lifting of how the user interface works because we talked about it in depth on contacts. It's the same on companies. So I can do all of those same sales activities here.

Danielle Velt
I'm gonna see different information about the company because remember, contact fields and contact properties are related to the contact record. Company fields and company properties are related to the company record. So that's where we we can see the status of our company, their life cycle stage, their expiry date, and their lead status right here. I can also see different information about the core team that owns this record and then additional information about this company, and remember, at any point, can click on actions, view all properties if I need to see other company information and search for it and set other property values there. The one big difference that I will call out here is we have a credit tab on the company record.

Danielle Velt
We're gonna talk more about this in a future session, so I won't go super deep into this at this moment. But you'll notice at the top, the credit tab is here, and then the only difference you're going to see here as well between contact and company record is these filter activities. Right? We just saw that there were, I think, 30 some odd, maybe 38 different activity types of things that can happen to a contact and get logged on their record. For companies, it's a little bit less because there are different the Hubspot treats companies a little bit differently. Right? So a little bit less of what can happen here, but the sales activities remain the same. So you'll still see team activities, and you can toggle these on and off if you only want to see certain ones, and same with the communication pieces that are related to sales activities, and then on the right hand side, same exact thing. Right? We have our sections for associations. So I can see that this company record is actually associated with 3 aptitude 8 contacts.

Danielle Velt
And I can go back to the sales workspace at any point in time, and what I can do here as well is actually action my task list. So if I click on the tasks tab from inside of the sales workspace, this is where I can create new tasks on the right hand side, first and foremost. So I can click on create task, and remember, we already talked about how on the record itself, can create a new task. But I can do it here as well. So I can say I need to follow up. Maybe this is just a to do task type, so I'll keep it set to that, but I'll set the priority to high. I can choose which record to associate with.

Danielle Velt
So do I want it to be associated with a contact or a company? The way we choose that is where are we gonna be completing the activity. Do we need it to be on the company level or just the contact level, etcetera. So I can choose my company record, for example, and now this is associated with one record. This task is assigned to me by default, but I can change it if it needs to be assigned to someone else. Again, I'm not using a shared queue, so I won't select this. It's just for me, and maybe my due date is in two business days at 9AM in my time zone, and maybe I don't need a reminder email for this, and this is where reminder notes can go if I need them, and I can either hit create or create and add another.

Danielle Velt
So if I hit create and add another, it's just gonna keep this sidebar open for me while also still creating this task. If I need to, I can look at my tasks on the left hand side here based on what's due today, what's overdue, what's upcoming due. So these are all based on the due date. So what I select on the left over here, if I click on advanced filters, it's gonna show me how it's actually surfacing these different tasks and why. So the task is not completed, the task is assigned to me, and the due date is greater than or equal to a certain date. So there's all these different views. I can even create a new view for myself.

Danielle Velt
Right? I can choose to create a saved view. So maybe this is all of my email to dos. I can click on create view, and then I can set some advanced filters here. So email to dos, I'm gonna edit these filters by clicking on advanced filters, edit filters, add a filter, and I'm gonna choose task type is any of, and I'm gonna choose email. So then all of that has been applied. I can click on the x, and now I have a different set of tasks here, and I can click on save view on the right hand side. So that's perfect. That is my own saved view in my sales workspace, and when I'm ready, I can choose to start all of these tasks.

Danielle Velt
At any time as well, we have the same user interface here that we saw on contacts and companies for the last couple of days. We can choose to filter with these quick filters, maybe to just show a specific task type, a specific due date, priority, etcetera. But when I click on start all, what you'll notice is it's taking me into my task queue. So up at the top, this is the biggest difference from what we've just been seeing on these contact and company records. This white bar up at the top shows me or indicates to me that I'm in my task queue. So I can see the name of the task up at the top left. I can see the reschedule button.

Danielle Velt
So this means I need to change the due date. So do I need to set a new due date? Yeah. Maybe. I need this to be due in two days, and I'm gonna save that. Right? I could still choose to complete it right now, but just wanna show what that what that will do if I reschedule it, and because I chose the email task type, I think I mentioned this briefly before, and now we're demoing it. The fact that if I choose the email task type here, Hubspot is going to automatically pull up this email tab, trying to, again, save you a click, save you a little bit of time, just pull that out for you. Oh.

Scott Sears
No. I see something.

Danielle Velt
And then once I'm done, let's say I've actually sent this email, I can click on next. So then it's gonna bring me to the next, the next next task on the next record that I have a task for. So in my examples, these records are all associated with one another, but in your real day to day, they might not be. Right? You're gonna have a lot of different tasks across a lot of different company records, and so this is just an example of how we go through the task queue, and it brings you directly to the next one on the right record. So it's really important to associate your task with the right record so that it brings you straight there.

Danielle Velt
At any time too, rather than rescheduling, I could just say, wanna skip this task for now. It's not due for a couple days, so I'm gonna click click on skip. It's gonna bring me to the next one, and once I'm done, so I can send my email. Let's just say I'm gonna send this email really quick. I can say send and complete task at the bottom here. So boom. All done, and then I can click next.

Danielle Velt
And let's say it's not an email task, maybe it's just a to do task. Nothing is expected to pop up here in that case because it's a to do. So then I could just hit complete when I'm done and then go to the next one, and at any point in time, I can choose where it says progress right here. There will be a list to show, hey. These are all the tasks that you have upcoming if you keep, you know, hitting skip or hitting complete and going forward. I could actually skip down to another task if I don't wanna do this one just yet. So it's always showing me my progress and where I'm at in that order.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Doing a quick time check here. Do we wanna really quickly see if we have any big questions here before I talk about setting us up, teeing us up for homework?

Ashley Marie Suski
No. Go ahead. If they have any questions, we can.

Danielle Velt
Use our work block tomorrow to answer those. Alright. Perfect, then what I'm gonna do is bring us back over to contacts. So remember, either go to CRM or bookmarks and go back to contacts. The way that I want us to complete our homework in a very organized way is we are going to have everyone create their own company and contact record, specifically, to practice these different activities that we've been talking about today. So in order to do this, I'm gonna put this first piece of it's prep homework for everybody. So on this contacts page, up in the top right corner, we're gonna click on add contacts and then create new, and what you're going to do is enter your traffic's email address here and enter your first name and last name. So that way, you have, yes, in production. In production, we are okay. Right now to have our own contact and company record. Just please make sure that the contact has your email address tied.

Danielle Velt
So we wanna create our contact record here with our email, first name and last name, and then hit create, and make sure that you are set as a contact owner. That should be a default, but just wanna make sure that it can actually show up in your sales workspace for you, and then we also wanna make sure that we have a company record that we can work with. Ashley, you let me know if you think this would be a little more organized. We could have one for for instance, one Trafix company record that everyone can associate their contact with so that they have both records to play around with a bit here.

Ashley Marie Suski
That would be fine.

Scott Sears
Okay. Awesome. What if you if there's a a lot I have another email address within the system for something else. How do I get around that?

Danielle Velt
Oh, sorry, Scott. You just said that you already have a contact in production with your email address tied?

Scott Sears
Yeah. For it's a long story, but yeah.

Danielle Velt
Okay, and and I'm imagining we can't do too much testing with it. Correct?

Scott Sears
Probably not.

Danielle Velt
Okay. You can absolutely use mine. You can use the aptitude 8 one.

Scott Sears
Okay. You got it.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Thank you for the question.

Ashley Marie Suski
But.

Danielle Velt
Yes, I wanna make sure everyone has a record that they can play around with for homework and be able to create these these different types of sales activities, see how they show up, be able to pin things, edit things. So that is your setup for that homework, and then before go live with Hubspot, we are, of course, gonna clear out that information. We're gonna make sure that any test information is cleared out later on. Alright.

Danielle Velt
That's everything I have. I know we only have about, I think, a minute and a half left here. Any quick questions we can answer before we're finishing for the day?

Ashley Marie Suski
We do have a work block tomorrow. It looks like it is at 02:30 eastern right before our next train the trainer session. So if you have any outstanding questions, anything you wanna traffic size or request review, we can do it then as well.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. Thanks everybody again for listening to me and watching me go through everything today. I appreciate all of the questions and participate.

Ashley Marie Suski
We have gone through our first 4. Hubspot trainings. What? It's happening.

Ashley Marie Suski
And I just want to remind everyone, again, camera's on if you have the ability to do so. If not, just message me on the side. I got you, and we are joined today by the lovely Danny and Anna from a 8. They are our integration partner, and while they are experts in Hubspot, they are not experts in traffics like the rest of us. So this isn't going to be a traffics workshop jam. This is just them walking us through the system. You can feel free to join us for any of the optional train the trainer blocks, and we can go over how this really is gonna work for traffics for the all org rollout. We will be adding those little pieces in there for it. But right now, we're just learning the system.

Ashley Marie Suski
That's one heck of a plug. Thank you.

Ashley Marie Suski
Take it away, Danny.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Thanks, Ashley. Hello again, everybody. Nice to see you, and yeah, super excited that we are as of today, we're pretty much halfway through all of our training sessions, which is crazy. So as always, we're gonna have the same format for training today. Remember, we are in our production environment. So if you wanna follow along there, please feel free to do so. If it's gonna be more distracting for you to follow along at the same time, just focus on my screen as we go through things. We're gonna pause throughout training today as we normally do, after learning about quite a few new features and tools or processes, and at the very end, we will continue to do some q and a we'll leave at least about 10 minutes is what I try to aim for, during each of these sessions.

Danielle Velt
So today is all about discovery quotes and deals. So we're talking more about sales activities, initiating an RFP, creating deals in the sales pipeline, and where does the pricing team come into play in terms of collaborating on an RFP record. So, I'm going to share my screen. Alright. You should be seeing our Hubspot production environment, and remember, this is my home page that we're looking at right now. So we're still looking at this sample data dashboard because my home page is dashboards, and this dashboard is set as my default. I actually do wanna make one call out to tack onto yesterday's training before we dive directly into some new terminology, and a previous terminology recap going into deals.

Danielle Velt
So yesterday, we discussed Hubspot sequences quite a bit, but there is one more time saving functionality that we didn't quite get to that I want to quickly cover now while we have, a couple of minutes, which is how we actually enroll contacts into a sequence in bulk, how we create tasks in bulk, and how we can edit records in bulk. So if we come over to our sidebar navigation, remember, if you bookmarked contacts, for example, that's where I'm gonna run this example. You can go to your bookmark section, find contacts, and go to it from there. If you haven't bookmarked this yet, you can go to the CRM section here, and at the top, you'll see contacts, and you can click on it.

Danielle Velt
So we talked a lot yesterday, again, about individually enrolling a contact into a sequence, individually creating tasks, and where and how we can do those things, and we talked about doing individual in line edits to different properties. But, again, if you're in a situation where it makes most sense to do any of those things in bulk, I wanna make sure everybody is empowered and knowledgeable on how to do so. So on this contacts home page, what I can do, first, I wanna make sure that I'm actually filtering for the contacts that I want to either enroll in a sequence, create tasks for, or edit in bulk. So what I'm actually going to do is I actually want to just set a filter for last activity date.

Danielle Velt
So let's say my last activity date was actually last month, so that's kind of far away from today. Right? So maybe I have there's a lot of contacts that show up in this view, but just wanna give the example of we're likely in a real real world scenario going to filter for the contacts that we need first or use one of our views to do so. Right? One of these tabs at the top, different saved views that we have or that our teammates have saved that we can use, and from there, I can do one of two things. I can either click on this checkbox right to the left of the name column at the top here, and that's gonna tell you up at the top here, I've selected a 100 contacts.

Danielle Velt
Because at the bottom, what you'll notice me to fall out to it. In the bottom right here, it says you can show either 25 contact records per page, 50, or a 100. So right now, I'm selected on a 100. If you set if you would rather see this at a 150, or 25, you can set it to what you wanna see, and it should save for just your user until you choose to change it again. So right now, it's showing me that I have a 100 contacts selected. Maybe you only want a few of the a few of these contacts. Excuse me. So what I could do then is individually select them like this. So now I only have 4 contacts selected, for example, and what you notice is this is a new bar that's popped up.

Danielle Velt
Right? There's a few different options here, and the ones that I want to highlight most are edit, create tasks, and enroll in sequence. So if I click on edit, this is going to allow me to update a property. Remember, a property is the same thing as a field. I've been using those two words pretty interchangeably up to this point. So we can choose to edit a property or field on these 4 contact records. So maybe it is just for example's sake. Maybe it's their lead status. So I can search for the name of that field here and then select it, and then I'm choosing what I want to update their lead status to, I'm not actually going to update this just because this is just an example's sake, but.

Danielle Velt
I could say, I know that all of these are in progress and I want to manually make that update, and then I would just click update there. So really easy way to do this, but we just need to keep in mind that this is setting the same property for all 4 of these contacts to the same exact value. So in some cases, that might be useful for us. In others, it might not. Alright. The other thing here is creating tasks. So if I click on create tasks, I still have my 4 contacts selected here. If I click on create tasks, similar thing is happening here. I'm creating 4 individual tasks. Right? It says create tasks for 4 contacts, and so I am choosing the same task type.

Danielle Velt
Maybe they're all email tasks. The priority is medium on all of them, they're all going to be assigned to me, and they're all, in this case, going to have the same due date. So maybe that's in two business days at 9AM, and maybe I don't need a reminder for any of these, and then I can click on create task. So that'll create those tasks, and then that drops them into our tasks view from inside of the sales workspace, and then the last piece here is enroll in sequence. So again, we talked about what sequence sequences are yesterday. So a Hubspot sequence is automation. It's one type of Hubspot automation. So it's essentially a series of automated emails and automated tasks that get assigned to you so that it it makes it a lot easier for you to follow up with contacts, and as soon as they engage back with you and they follow up with you on that email thread, they will be unenrolled from that automated sequence so that you can carry on the conversation now that you have them engaged to move forward.

Danielle Velt
So I can click on enroll in sequence, and same thing that we saw yesterday is gonna pop up here. I need to choose what sequence I want. Remember, we wanna be selected on the owner any instead of me just in case it defaults you there. So I can select the sequence that I need, and then it will tell me in this case, it's because I don't have an email address here. But let's actually use a different example because I really wanna show exactly what this looks like.

Danielle Velt
Let's choose our sequence one more time. I'm gonna say continue with two contacts. So now it's pulling up the same window that we saw yesterday where I can customize this sequence for each of my contacts. So it's taking us into a new view where I can personalize it still for each contact. So for junior and for Anna, I can choose how everything shows up here in in these different emails, in this content, and in any tasks. But I'm still technically enrolling them in bulk. Right? So this is essentially my editor to make sure that the content shows up for them in these emails the way that I want them to, and once I have removed all of the placeholders that we see up here at the top, that's when I will have the ability to enroll two out of two contacts. Alright. Gonna have us leave that page. Do we have any big questions before I bring us into shifting gears and we're gonna talk about deals?

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. Thanks for letting me go over that with everybody. Alright. We are going to, as I mentioned a second ago, switch gears and talk about discovery quotes and deals. So I'm gonna do a bit of a new terminology recap, but also a couple of new terms with us, and the first thing I wanna do just to give us a visual of what we're gonna be talking about is I'm gonna go to my bookmarks and I'm gonna click on deals, and again, if you don't have this bookmarked yet, go to CRM first and then click on or excuse me. We're going to the sales workspace to find our deals. You can also go to your deals from CRM.

Danielle Velt
However, it's not dropping you into your sales workspace the same way that you will be right here. So if I click on the deals tab within my sales workspace, it will look the same as CRM deals. However, your sales workspace gives you much easier access as we know at this point to all of these different tabs just to make it much easier to navigate within this portion of the system. So remember, a deal is a potential sale with a dollar amount attached. This is where we're tracking the revenue in our pipeline. We can track RFPs here, and our quoting process. Deals progress through the stages inside of a deal pipeline, and remember, in Netsuite, it's an opportunity.

Danielle Velt
In Hubspot, it's a deal. So opportunity or deal, those words are interchangeable here, and a deal pipeline is it's the process that deals go through from the creation of the deal throughout that the process of the deal going to either won or lost. Right? So the deal pipeline is all of these different stages that you see in front of you, and we're gonna break down exactly, what all of these are as we go through today's session as well as Monday's session. Today, we're focused more on discovery and quote, but these are all the different stages within the sales pipeline, and then the deal stages themselves are can be thought of as milestones, essentially, that a deal goes through on its journey to either being ultimately won or lost.

Danielle Velt
So the pipeline is kind of the umbrella that's then holding all of these different deal stages, and they always go left to right. So we're progressing from one milestone to the next, and the intention is to move left to right all the way to the point of being won or lost. Alright. So when we have a new opportunity identified, right, we are identifying a new potential opportunity, to sell. What we can do in Hubspot is create a deal. So on the right hand side, this is gonna look very similar to what we saw over the past few sessions with creating contacts and creating companies manually. So on the right hand side, we can click on add deals, this button, and then click on create new.

Danielle Velt
So. I can choose the deal name that I want here. If you choose to create your deal from a contact or company record, which you can also do, The deal name will likely auto populate based on the contact name or the company name. So I can choose what name I want to give my deal in this case because I'm just doing it from the deals page. But I'm going to just label this as training demo two, and in our case today, we're talking about the sales pipeline. So I wanna make sure that the pipeline is selected to sales pipeline. We have a few different sale, excuse me, a few different deal pipelines here in Hubspot. But for today, we're gonna be mostly focused on the sales pipeline, and then what you'll see here is Hubspot is going to automatically start this deal off in the first stage, and in this particular pipeline, it's the discovery stage.

Danielle Velt
So. I have to create this deal on the discovery stage. What you're seeing on my screen where it says you can buy bypass pipeline rules, that's because I have elevated admin permissions in the system. You will likely not see that. You will likely be asked, to only create this deal in the discovery, stage because it's the first one of this whole pipeline, and any fields here in this deal creation form that you see with an asterisk next to them, that means it's a required field to be able to create this deal, and then I can enter an amount. I can also enter a deal type. So let's say it's new business because I'm working with somebody who is a prospect, a company that's a prospect, and then I need to set my service line.

Danielle Velt
So for this example, I'm just gonna choose LTL as my service line, but you can choose multiple of these. So if I add additional ones, you'll see them all here, and then I can choose my deal team. So if there are multiple other teammates that I'm working with here, this is a multi select, and I can choose the rest of my deal team here. The close date will automatically be set as the end of the current month we're in, but you can edit that. You can choose to push that out if if needed. So I can choose January 30, for example. The deal owner, similar to everything else. Right? When we create a contact, when we create a company, when we create a task, it's autumn automatically going to be assigned to me, but I can choose to change that if I'm, you know, creating a record on someone else's behalf, another user.

Danielle Velt
So that's for me. The priority is not required here, but I can still set one, and then this is an important field that I wanna call out. This is our RFP required field. So if I select yes. For RFP required, that is going to tell Hubspot to automatically create an RFP record and associate it with the deal that I'm creating now. So just be aware of that. You can choose to create the RFP this way by selecting yes. Now, or you can create the RFP later. So if you ever set this RFP required field to yes, it will spin up an RFP record for you and automatically associate it to your deal. So again, you can set this at a later date.

Danielle Velt
Remember, this is a field on the deal record. So when I'm actually on the deal record, we'll be able to see that field and you could choose at a later stage in this deal's progression that you need to add an RFP. But if I don't need to, I would select no. For example's sake, because we're gonna be talking about RFPs very shortly here, I'm going to select yes, and then again, if I am creating the deal from just the deal's homepage, I need to then choose which company and which contact I need to associate this with. Because remember, a deal is a potential opportunity to sell to someone. Right? It needs to either be a contact, a company, or both.

Danielle Velt
Right? We have somebody that we are trying to sell to, so I'm gonna use my training demo company. So I'm searching for what I need here. So it's the training demo company and the training demo contact that I've been using in our last few sessions here, and these are the last two fields. It's just associating the deal with our company and our contact, and then I can click create, and what Hubspot is going to do is it automatically takes us into this new deal record so that we can start, again, reviewing the information, and we probably remember from our last couple of sessions, this user interface is very similar across contacts, companies, and deals, and what I wanna do here is highlight any differences the same way we did between contacts and companies.

Danielle Velt
Right? There were there were those small differences between what is tracked on these records, but they're not not very big differences typically. So what I'm seeing at the top here is the name of my deal. If I click on the pencil icon, I can change that or I can change the amount at any time if needed. I can also change the close date if I need to push it out. So I'll see my calendar pop back up and I can choose a different date. I'm in the sales pipeline. If I needed to ever change the pipeline and change the stage, you can technically do that from right here. If the process requires if this particular pipeline process requires that we manually move a deal stage, so from discovery to quote, which is the next stage, it's just the one right right below it, then I can do that from here, and I will do that in just a moment here.

Danielle Velt
We have all the same sales activity options here that we saw on the contact and company record. Right? I can leave a note. I can send an email, make a phone call, create a task, schedule a meeting, or enroll in a sequence or log any of those different activities. If if, for instance, I made a call outside of Hubspot that did not get logged here, that's a situation where I would choose log a call versus if I wanted to log a meeting because the meeting was never tracked inside of Hubspot. Right? You have the ability to log those things if you can't perform those actions or did not perform those actions directly inside of Hubspot at the time, and then we have an about this deal section.

Danielle Velt
Remember, these are all the fields that we're surfacing to you on the record, but you can always choose this actions drop down if you need to see something else here that you're not seeing, and you can click on view all properties, and this is where we see all the different deal fields that exist. So remember, we talked about the other day how for contacts, the fields that you're seeing on the contact record are solely related to the contact. They are glued to that contact. Same thing for company. The company fields that exist in the sidebar on the company record are glued to that company. They are very specific fields and field values for that company, and it's the same here.

Danielle Velt
These are all deal properties or deal fields that are related to all of the deals, and remember, this is just one deal record. So the values that I'm seeing here are very specific to this deal record, and I can search dynamically for any property I need. Maybe I want to update my agreement type, and so I can set that here. As long as I have the ability to edit the property, then I will see the ability to click and type or make any selections that I need to, alright. One other thing to call out is we can add what's called a collaborator on a deal. So if you do have two reps that you need to be on this deal, you can, choose to do that.

Danielle Velt
But we do also have the multi select property mentioned before called deal team where you can tag your teammates as well, and then similar to with contacts and companies, we have the overview tab right here. Hubspot is always going to try and show you some data highlights, any recent activities. For deals, there is what's called a deal score. So deal score is helping you understand. It is Hubspot generated, and it tries to help you understand the likelihood of closing that deal based on all of the activities, all the historical activities that have happened over time. So as it says here, it's letting us know that it's still calculating the deal score. I'm not surprised because this this is a very new deal that doesn't have much activity just yet, and then if Hubspot can give us any deal insights, those will also show up here, any risks risks or buyer goals. But you will always see what is powered by Hubspot AI. So deal score, deal insights, and then this Breeze record summary that we've talked about in the past is also powered by Hubspot AI. Danielle, can we pause really quick? Yes. So.

Jeremy Schlachet
When you give access to other people in the deal, there's some questions in there. That's how you give visibility, Scott. But from a subject matter expert or the only people that have visibility to the deal is the salesperson, the boss, and then up unless they get added to the deal manually. I don't even think oh, that's a good question. Will account managers have visibility to a deal if they're not associated to the deal?

Ashley Marie Suski
If they're associated to the company, the company is associated to the deal. So that's how that visibility would work.

Jeremy Schlachet
Okay. So if you wanted to add, like, I don't know, warehousing and you did Tim Tim, you'd have to add Tim manually, and then Tim would get access to the deal from their point forward. So the rights are the same as Netsuite. So it's important, Sears, that if we're gonna do this, we have to add the right subject matter experts on that deal for them to get visibility to the deal in the system. Right. Because they because that's gonna sit on their pipeline. They're gonna have their own, deal board, but the only way they're gonna have access to their deal board is that they get associated to the the the opportunity or the deal. Sorry.

Scott Sears
So do the notes for a specific deal flow only into that deal, or is it flow up to the company, and if it is the deal. Okay. So, hypothetically, if I posted the note associated with the deal, and I posted that note in the in the deal section, I wouldn't have any access to any of the notes that may have been attributed in the wrong potential. So we have to train people to make sure that they're updating the deals rather than the actual company in that situation. Is that right? So.

Ashley Marie Suski
If you go I'll show you. So and or Danny, do you wanna show them how, like, when you're at the company, how the Breeze record summary summarizes it so they can see?

Danielle Velt
Yeah. So on the right hand side so we're gonna see those associations we've talked about before so we can see the contact that's associated to this deal and the company. So I can click on the company name to go directly to the company record, and I will see yeah. The Breeze record summary will take a second just to load.

Ashley Marie Suski
But you can see that there's lots of follow up actions. There's different things, and the way visibility is going to work, though, right now, I know RDOs are going to have visibility to, like, anyone that's under them. So and then we're trying to have all the CRM open to them so they can tag whoever they need to tag on accounts, and I'm thinking I'm trying to do the same for that for SMEs so they have visibility to whatever mode is tagged in a deal.

Scott Sears
Alright. Cool. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Awesome, and I will just highlight again, one thing that we talked about the other day or yesterday when we talked about sales activities. If I'm creating a note I'm just going off of, a bit of what Scott just mentioned. If I'm creating a note here, I can provide more visibility by making sure it's associated across these different records. If for some reason, right, we we need to, hubspot is automatically going to do this by default based on the associated records that you have here. But you could double down on that. Just make sure that it's associating with all the records that you want. If for some reason, somebody is looking at the deal record instead of the company record, it'll show up on both of those records even though you're technically leaving the note here, and same with these other activities that we see here.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I'm gonna bring us back over to the deal. So this is the deal that I had just created over in this association section. So if I click on it, it's gonna bring me right back here, and if I click on the activities tab in this middle panel here, this is one other difference between the activities tab across contacts, companies, and deals. So where it says filter by, we remember this from the other day. I can say filter activity, and I can select all or I can unselect everything. I can be very specific in what I want to see. Right? Check any of these boxes on or off, and so same as with companies, there's a little bit less in terms of what types of overall general activities and events are going to be, are going to show up on the deal record specifically.

Danielle Velt
So contacts, there's the most possible activities and events because those are individual people. But with the company and with the deal, you might see some different options here. So just be aware of that. They're not completely different. As we can see, we still have all of our communication and team activity pieces here which are very sales focused, and again, it's always going to show us the most recent information from, in our case, December, and it'll go further back if if this deal was created in November, for example, and then anything upcoming. So if I schedule a task for the future or a meeting for the future, etcetera, upcoming will appear above this, and then I could even pin a note or pin an activity to the very top of the record, and then on the right hand side, again, we have our Breeze record summary, which over time is going to be able to give us, a summary of what's been going on with that particular record, and I can see associations.

Danielle Velt
So who is the contact that's associated, what is the company that's associated, etcetera. Alright. I'm gonna bring us back to the deal board. But before I do that, one thing I wanna call out, I I'm gonna move the deal stage manually a different way. But just so that we remember, we can do it from right here. So in the top left corner of the deal record, I'm currently in that first deal stage, which is discovery, and I could move it to quote, and discovery is our initial qualification of this opportunity. Quote is the point where we're building the pricing and solution offering. So I'm gonna bring us back to the deal board within my sales workspace, and actually, I don't wanna go all the way back to my sales workspace.

Danielle Velt
So I'm gonna go to my bookmarks and then sales workspace just so we can orient ourselves there. Click on the deals tab. Alright. So this is a big difference in terms of how deals show up for us. Right? We're gonna talk a lot about this view that we see in front of us. This is called the board view. I know we we saw a little glance of this earlier when I was explaining deal stages in the pipeline. So we saw this with contacts and companies the other day. There's a view type in the center of this page next to the search bar, and deals will or deals should default to this board view for you. There is also the table view.

Danielle Velt
So if I wanted to click on table view, this looks more familiar to us based on everything we've learned so far. Right? We can see that list of deals. These are the individual deal records that exist in Hubspot right now. I can see the current deal stage, the close date, who is the owner, is there an amount, and what is it. Right, and as always, I could choose to edit those columns, right, by clicking on the edit columns button. We saw this yesterday where I can add just by checking the box on the left and search for different columns, and I can also move them around or remove any that I don't want by x ing them out and then click on apply, or I could even drag these.

Danielle Velt
So if I want deal owner to be to the right, move that over to the right. As always, I can also filter, use my quick filters or my advanced filters up at the top here right under the search bar, and I can also sort. Right? We remember we could do this with contacts and companies. We can also do this with deals. If you need to sort by, for example, last activity date. Right? If we're trying to kind of understand some of the maybe the oldest deals that a certain rep has and you know, you wanna target those that don't have a recent last activity date. We can do things like that. So all of those same capabilities, even if we move over to the board view, and what I will say here too is for contacts, companies, and deals, you will also have this report view, the Gantt view, and the calendar view.

Danielle Velt
I would say explore those at your own leisure. I would say to start off, the table view for contacts and companies and the board view for deals are gonna be the most powerful for you. So we're gonna go back to the board view by clicking here and clicking on board view. Alright, and one important thing to note here as well, I am already selected on the sales pipeline. So right next to where it says board view under view type, it says sales pipeline. So I can choose sales pipeline, pop pipeline, or quick sale pipeline. You'll notice that I cannot choose all pipelines. It is grayed out. In the table view, I can view all the deals across all of these pipelines if I would like to, but when I'm in the board view, the whole point of the board view is to be able to see the deals that fall into the stages of the pipeline, and because in Hubspot, you can have multiple deal pipelines and they can all have different stages, You can only view one of those pipelines at a time in the board view.

Danielle Velt
It probably would not really be possible or would not be pretty to try and view multiple pipelines on the board view at one time. So just be aware of that. That is one, caveat there to the board view. You're looking at and you're diving deep into one pipeline at a time. But, again, all of the same things we just talked about in terms of filtering, sorting, searching. Right? I can dynamically search for any deal name and see what comes up. Just going with one that I just saw. So now it's just gonna show me, great. I have Bexos truckload right here.

Danielle Velt
And then it will load everything back up again, and with any of these deals so they're gonna show up as cards, essentially. Right? They're just these square cards that I can see in front of me. One thing I wanna call out here is you're seeing on some of these cards high visibility and prospect. These are what are called deal tags in Hubspot. So high visibility. Right now, this means that we have a very large deal amount here. I believe it's over a $100,000. Means that this will get tagged as high visibility, and prospect means that this is not a current customer. So just be aware of those two deal tags that might pop up. That's why they are there.

Danielle Velt
Each of these cards could have some deal tags on it. It's also going to show the name of the deal and then give you just some quick information about this deal. So what is the current amount, the current close date, who is the owner, and what was the create date, and then at the bottom here, it will show you that, for example, with this deal, Target Corporation and this particular contact are associated with this deal, and at the very bottom of this card, I can take very quick actions here. So if I want to preview this deal, it's gonna load up the preview on the side here, which is very nice. So I can go all the way into the record by clicking on view record or on the left here just clicking on the name of the deal.

Danielle Velt
But it's pretty nice that I can see, a preview before having to go all the way into the record, and I can take any of these sales actions, right, any of these activities up at the top from right here, or I can inline edit the close date, for example, inline edit the pipeline of the deal stage. You'll see in the preview your Breeze record summary, the basic information about the deal that we saw on the record, any pinned activities. Right? We talked about pinning activities earlier, any recent activities, and you can actually filter for what you want those to be. So, again, that communication section and the team activity section are very sales focused, so that's why those appear there for you.

Danielle Velt
Any upcoming activities, the deal score, deal insights, etcetera. So everything is here, the associations, so that you really don't have to click into the record, unless you really need to deep dive further or you feel more comfortable having the full page layout to edit your deal. I can x out of that at any point in time. Also, you actually don't even need to click on the preview. You can actually just click, on the card itself and not click on the name. The clicking on the name will bring you straight into the record. Gonna refresh my page there. Alright. So clicking on the name will bring you straight into that deal record. The other quick actions we have here are we can get a summary on the right hand side.

Danielle Velt
So this brings us back to the AI assistant. So if you wanna get a different summary from from the Breeze record summary and you want to have Hubspot just give you an update as of this very second, you can do that right here, and you can start a conversation with the AI assistant, or I can create an email from right here. So it's gonna have that pop up for me right here, and it's going directly to the contact on that deal. I can create a note from right here. So doing all of these different activities, it will log it to that deal even though I'm not inside of the deal right now. So, again, pretty convenient, and similar to how we talked about taking some actions in bulk, I can check boxes next to any of these deals, and they can be across deal stages too, and I'm seeing what I saw before when we talked about how to take action in bulk.

Danielle Velt
I'm seeing that I've selected 4 deals, and I can choose to assign a new deal owner. I can share those records. I can edit a property, property value in bulk, create tasks in bulk, etcetera. I'll x that out to unselect them, and what I actually want to do here is I'm gonna click up at the top on my views here, so my deals because I only want to see my deal records here and have it go back to board view because I didn't have that set on this view, and what I'm gonna do is so this was the deal that I just created. I'm going to drag and drop this to the next stage. So that's why I was holding out on moving this to the quoting stage just so you could see it's very, easy to move deals to the next stage in the process, in the pipeline.

Danielle Velt
If there are any required fields, as Hubspot calls them, there will be a sidebar that pops out. We're gonna see this, a little bit more later on. But if there are any required fields, whether it's for an RFP, whether it's for a deal, you will see a sidebar pop out that will ask you to fill out those required fields before the deal can officially be saved in that next stage. So in this case, there are no required deals from discovery to quote stage. But if there is for solution design, I would drop it here and then that sidebar will pop out. It'll just ask me to save those values before I can save the deal stage change. Alright. I'm gonna pause here. We've gone through quite a bit with this deal board so far. Any major questions coming up?

Jeremy Schlachet
And you can click and drag those too. Right? I don't know if you showed that. Sorry. But you can you can just grab one and move it anywhere you want to, right?

Danielle Velt
Oh, sorry about that. Yes. Yep. We can we could even push a deal to a further stage. The only thing I want to call out with that, if you are skipping stages, in Hubspot, there is the ability to restrict from skipping stages in a pipeline. I don't believe that is the case in our sales pipeline as it's currently configured. So we should be able to, yes, just move I'm gonna move this other deal directly into solution design, and actually, there we go. We're gonna talk more about solution design on Monday, but this is a preview of what's to come. So this is certain information on the deal that I have to fill out before I can officially move that deal into, the solution design stage.

Scott Sears
Hey, Danielle. Does it require you to a sales rep to put in notes while it's in the solution design phase before it gets to or during the span of proposal and negotiation to continue the engagement? Because I think So The reason I asked one sec. We we have gotten in a habit as an organization of moving it from intro when you talk to the person, whether or not you made intro, to discovery, so you lock it in for 90 days, and then it goes to quote for the opportunity currently, and there's never any notes. Very, very rarely, there are notes in the that actual opportunity as to how it's progressing and whatnot. I think that if we can enable sales to go in there and as well as account managers to put in notes as the deal is in cycle, I think it would be very beneficial to all parties involved. Is that possible?

Danielle Velt
So right now right now, I don't believe we have that in place. But, Ashley, I was gonna say if if that's Yeah. I can take that.

Ashley Marie Suski
Future request. They have to if they're doing a deal, like, when she showed when you set it up, it asks for a bunch of different information. Are you talking about, like, you want them to add contact, like, phone calls?

Scott Sears
Yeah. So, like, say I submitted a piece, and then all of a sudden so and I'm gonna follow up. It's awards coming out in a month. You would think that the sales rep would call or contact the customer within a week or so, two weeks, whatever it may be, to say, hey. What's going on with this award? How are we looking? What can I do to progress this forward? We want we want to encourage that behavior in those deals moving forward.

Ashley Marie Suski
Gonna go for all of this when we do the traffics rollout training. This is just, like, how the system works, but those little things are accounted for. Like, there's notes when you haven't contacted someone in such a long time. Like, you'll be there's a dashboard that can see, like, they haven't touched base with this person. So, yeah, that's all the stuff that we get into when we teach it out.

Scott Sears
That's great. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Awesome. Alright. Perfect. Alright. I'm gonna keep us going. Just keeping an eye on our time here because I wanna make sure we can talk about RFPs as well. One other thing that I want to mention here that you probably saw right in front of me as well is there are deal metrics here. So I can see based on the view that I'm looking at, I can see some deal metrics. What is in my case, because these are my deals that are assigned to me. Right? I'm the deal owner. I can see my total deal amount, weighted deal amount, and just so that we are aware of what that means. So each of these deal stages have what's called a deal probability tied to them.

Danielle Velt
So for example, in the discovery stage, I'm just making this up for example sake, but it might be 10%. Right? At the discovery stage, this deal has a 10% likelihood of closing. Right? Closing one, and so that's where the weighted deal amount comes in because it's looking at calculating the amount of the deal times the deal probability. Right? It's it's showing us it's trying to show us a more realistic forecast for what will close, and then I can see open deal amount. So this is for any open stages, which are typically, all of the stages that are not closed won or closed lost, and then closed deal amount would be the opposite, any stages that are deemed as closed.

Danielle Velt
Our new deal amount, so any new deals that have been created recently, and then the average deal age. So it's looking at the create date when it calculates this for us, and you can actually click on any of these to see which deals are being taken into account for that metric for your data. And.

Ashley Marie Suski
Since I can already see your little wheel spinning, I just wanna let everyone know as we get more data and we see our likelihood of closing from discovery to quote, quote to solution design, etcetera, we can customize those percentages to make it so the funnel is more accurate.

Danielle Velt
Absolutely, and you'll see some broken down information per stage at the very bottom here. It's pretty small, but if I hover over the very bottom of the discovery stage section here all the way to the left, I'm gonna see the total amount and the weighted amount. Right, and actually okay. My my memory serves me correctly. This is actually at 10% right now. So you can see what that stage is weighted at. Alright. Awesome. We are going to flip over to RFPs. So. RFPs in Hubspot are another object for us. Right? So think of this similar to contacts, companies, and deals. There's the RFP object, and then there's also individual RFP records, and remember when I created that deal initially, I selected that, yes, I do need an RFP spun up right now.

Danielle Velt
So. I can get to my RFPs either from my bookmarks because I did bookmark it, or I would come back to my CRM section here, and at the very bottom right before this line kind of in the center here, I can click on RFPs, and this will bring me over to the table view of all of my RFPs. So with RFPs, I would also recommend using the board view because we do have different RFP stages. So you can think of this as very, very, very similar to a deal pipeline. So again, right now we're looking at the table view. We are very familiar with this view at this point. But where it says table view in the center right next to the search bar here, I'm gonna click on table view, and I'm gonna change this to board view.

Danielle Velt
So now I'm seeing the very specific RFP stages here. I'm seeing intake, documents required, etcetera. So and I can scroll all the way to the right because we have a lot of RFP stages right here. Right now, not too many records, but that is okay, and then again, we have different, quick filters up at the top here. I am actually going to search for my RFP here, just my example one. Alright. So what's going to happen when you create an RFP? The RFP number is going to be auto generated for you, so you will always see and again, this user interface, we, again, already did the hard lifting of talking about what this looks like for a deal on the deal board.

Danielle Velt
It's gonna function the same for RFPs. You're gonna see the name of the RFP. In this case, there's an RFP number. So that's a field on the RFP, and then I am the RFP owner, and I can see which contact this is associated with or excuse me, which company this is associated with. So this RFP is associated with my demo company record here, and then I have those same functionalities of being able to preview the information about this RFP before going into the record, creating an email, creating a note, or creating a task. So similar mostly the same similar sales activities right there, and what you'll notice is I can do the same thing here. I can drag and drop when I'm ready.

Danielle Velt
So let's say I'm ready to move this from intake to documents required. So I'm gonna drag and drop it, and this is a perfect example of what I mentioned before. There are required properties from intake to documents required in order to, to officially move it to that next stage. So I'm gonna do that really quickly here and just talk through it. So let's say my external due date is January 7 at 10AM. I'm gonna click apply, and that will save there. I have an internal due date of December 30, number of expected rounds. So you're gonna see what how do I fill out each of these fields. Right? Some of them are gonna show you a calendar because it's looking for a date or a date and time.

Danielle Velt
Some of these things will be open text fields, and some of them might be a drop down or a multi select. So I'm gonna choose different values here, and I'm gonna enter some specific values. So countries involved, can choose from my drop down here. Equipment type, I could choose multiple here. Operational requirements.

Danielle Velt
And another drop down. So you can see how easy it is to just plug in all of the values that are needed here.

Jeremy Schlachet
So from the traffic side, this is gonna be I mean, Cooper, this is our new form?

John Cooper
Yes. I was gonna put in the chat. This is the same combination of the intake form and Netsuite with just one additional question regarding how we wanna handle our incumbent business, should we have any.

Jeremy Schlachet
I mean, what a perfect way to have this seamlessly in the system and now have a board to track where they are in the RFP process. Do we do we have the ability to track which round we're in?

Jeremy Schlachet
Is that a.

Ashley Marie Suski
Is that a I'm not sure about. We just have because, like, the round is in just the RFP data. It's not like a round thing in, but I wonder if there are stages in the. RFP process. So I'm wondering if maybe we can add a something like that in future state, first round, second round. Like, that can be added if we do have multiple stages.

John Cooper
It's a fair point to bring up, Jeremy. Currently, like she said, we don't have a way to call out what the current round is. We could work with sales and at least going in and updating the due dates to match round two. So it would appear in the calendar correctly. But that's a good call out that we don't necessarily have accounted for quite yet.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Great questions. Great call outs. One thing I also wanna call out here is if you encounter a situation where you see new fields appear, essentially, what's happening there so I wanna give this example. So is this bid being run through a portal? If I select no, there are no additional fields to fill out here. But if I select yes, there are what are called conditional fields here that will appear. Because I've selected yes, I know that I need to enter a portal URL, portal username, and portal password in order to continue. For now, just for example's sake, I'll select no, and then I just need to make sure that I have entered information for all of these.

Danielle Velt
Some of these might only accept a number versus text. Okay. Perfect. So now that the apply button is no longer grayed out, I know that I'm good to go. I can click apply, and so now. I'm in documents required, and from here, I can choose to drag and drop, and again, you'll notice very quickly, okay, which of these stages require additional information to be filled out. Right? Because if you're able to just drag and drop, there's no required fields. But if we're moving from one field or excuse me, from one stage to the next and we see required fields pop up in that sidebar, we know we have to fill that out before we can continue. Alright. I do see a hand up. So I'm let's pause. Yeah.

Elan Ulfan
Yeah. Just quickly, I noticed before on the intake form or the thing that mimics the intake form, strategy looks like it's somewhere to just put, like, a couple of words. Is that gonna be enough space for people to write, like, good strategies for their RFPs?

Danielle Velt
Oh, yes. Let me pull that back up just to show it again so everyone knows what we're talking about here. So yeah. Was it the.

Elan Ulfan
Like, it just looks like you would write.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Our initial strategy right here.

Elan Ulfan
With winning lanes or like, this can they write, like, a long strategy in this?

Danielle Velt
Yeah. So we can enter quite a few characters here. This should be a multiline text field, which is additional characters beyond what's called a single line text field. So with a single line text field in Hubspot, you can only enter a certain amount of characters, and with multiline text, you can enter, like, paragraphs.

Ashley Marie Suski
When I did my tests, I was able to put a couple sentences in there.

Elan Ulfan
Okay. Yeah. Because we've seen people with strategies in a couple words which aren't helping us win. So that's that's where the question came from.

Danielle Velt
No worries. Absolutely.

Elan Ulfan
Okay. Okay.

Danielle Velt
Awesome. I'm going to actually click into this other RFP record that I have. Just to show, again, very, very similar user interface here, but we do have a couple of extra tabs in the center pane that I want to call out. So the left and the right panels here that you see are gonna look very, similar to what we've already seen on the other object types in those records. Right? On contact company and deal, we see the basic information at the top, the sales activity options. We see the primary information in those fields, and then on the right hand side, we see associations to other records. But in the center of the RFP record, you do still have the overview tab over on the right here and the activities tab.

Danielle Velt
So those function as we know at this point. But we also have the RFP tab here, which have a stage tracker. So from right here, I can choose to move to documents required, for example, and fill that out, and I can also fill out my intake required fields from right here as well. So if I want to do this before the point of trying to move the the RFP from the first stage to the second stage, I can actually get ahead of it right here. So if I'd prefer to not do it in a sidebar and to just fill out all of the information here, if anything has dependent fields, as I mentioned before, or conditional fields, that will show up here.

Danielle Velt
So, for example, if I say no on this field, there isn't anything. But if I select yes, right, can the customer find us for any reason, I would need to enter what can they find us for and save that. But, otherwise, I can save these different details right here, and then when I go to move the stage to documents required, the sidebar will still pop out, but it will already have the values that I previously entered in the center pane. So again, you can make it even easier on yourself by by doing all of this earlier so that it's not as much information to fill out at one time when you're trying to move that stage. So remember, intake required fields are on this RFP tab.

Danielle Velt
There's also an additional information and customer information section. So these are being broken out into different sections for you, and they're all able to be in line edited, and then when we get to the point of documents required, that is when we're kicking it over to our pricing team. So the pricing team has their own tab right here where they can fill out additional updates or additional field values in line as well, and we also have the awards tab. So this is related to all of our different awards information that the pricing team would fill out as well. Alright. I know we only have a few minutes left, I wanna make sure that I can give some space to any additional questions that we might have.

Danielle Velt
Are we all feeling like experts? I would love that.

Ashley Marie Suski
I mean, I have to say, I was doing something earlier. I don't even remember what it was. It's like, oh, where is this, and it took me 3 seconds to find it, and I had never done that task before, so just how intuitive the system is is magical.

Danielle Velt
Love it. That's awesome. Alright. Well, let's give everybody some space. I'm I'm comfortable with some silence. We wanna give everybody a second to think if they have any questions that we want to address in our last few minutes here based on the topics that we covered today.

Jeremy Schlachet
Just to note, as we've been playing around with this, the universal search is incredible. It's it it's gonna help you find almost anything. So, like, even if you wanted I set up Dialpad, like, anything you wanna do in that search hub on the top is really a good point, and also, I mean, you can even search phone numbers. If you're like, oh, someone's calling me. I don't know who it is. You can type it into the search spot, and it'll tell you the contact if they're not in your phone. So this is AAA much better search system, and it separates the company and the contacts and the phone number. So the universal search is like a true universal search. It's probably one of the best I've seen in a search site. No offense, Jay.

Jeremy Schlachet
I'm taking.

Ashley Marie Suski
Poor Jay. She's just, like, just still over here working with Netsuite, and that girl ain't going down with a fight either. So Well.

Jeremy Schlachet
Netsuite's not going away. It's still our ERP system.

Jeremy Schlachet
This was great. I I hopefully, the silence is that people are either just amazed by how great it was today or they're so confused. They have no idea what questions to ask. But this seems pretty simplistic, and I thought it was Danielle, this was great. This was really a a great one. So thank you.

John Cooper
One thing I do wanna quickly call out while we do our homework, regarding RFP section, we are still working on the testing that allows notification to go to the pricing team and to the salesman in the same email versus different emails. So if you guys are testing it, you might notice it just goes to you. We'll get one separately. It's a known problem that they are looking into.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Thanks for the call out, John, and amazing. I'm glad that everyone's learning, and I appreciate everybody's engagement too in asking questions when you have them and raising your hand.

Jeremy Schlachet
Danielle, do they if I know we're still in you can erase the data. So do we want people to maybe enter one or two deals to companies that they added yesterday as a trial today? Is that something we want maybe them to do?

Danielle Velt
Create a deal for homework?

Jeremy Schlachet
Yeah. Like, whatever company they created yesterday because I saw, like, WESL Corporation and all that. Like, maybe everyone should create just one deal inside of that just and then they can ask questions tomorrow if they have any problems doing that. Ashley, Jen, I don't wanna overstep what you guys have. I don't know if we have any homework tonight, but that would be.

Ashley Marie Suski
Sir, we report to you.

Jeremy Schlachet
Well, that would be a Everyone. That would be a I think if everyone can enter one or two deals, I just entered, it's just I just want everyone to see how quick and easy and seamless it is. I think it would be good for everyone to enter one or two just to get used to the system. That'd be a a good testing.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. There there shouldn't be a problem with it. Yeah. I because, Jeremy, to your point, we're gonna be wiping test data before well before go live to be able to make sure we have accurate real data in production. So, yes, for now, we can create those test deals in production and we'll make sure we're clearing out test data later on. Try it with an RFP.

Ashley Marie Suski
Without an RFP. Try both. Yeah. Tim, what's up?

Tim Huizinga
I relevant to what I said in the chat earlier about can we have custom fields based on the mode for an RFP? Where can. I view what those are for warehousing? Where can I get feedback? Where can I ask questions? Is it in there already?

Ashley Marie Suski
It is in there already. It's it literally, right now, the RFP form is just anything that goes to John's team. So it's literally exactly what we have now, the same questions that are asked, and then so if when you fill it out, they'll pick anything warehousing related, and you'll see what pops out with it, and then yeah, any feedback or suggestions you have, you can write those down, and we can see what we can do to enhance that.

John Cooper
Sounds good. Thank you. The RFP level doesn't contain warehousing questions. The deal portion itself might. I just wanna make sure we haven't added that layer. Tim, if you're interested in having that, we can talk on the side and see if we can work on implementing that after we roll it out. Sounds good.

Ashley Marie Suski
Hannah, is it not letting you do it in sandbox or in production? Production. It's just grayed out for me. Are you the owner of, like, the company and stuff?

Hannah Peth
No, and maybe that's the reason. Try that.

Ashley Marie Suski
See if that helps.

Grant Wessel
So I I am. I'm having the same problem. I am the owner. Now I did create the deal first and then went in to add the RFP after the the deal was already created. I don't know if that's part of the issue instead of doing it all at once.

Ashley Marie Suski
I think you need to create it right now at the start of the deal if it has an RFP.

Grant Wessel
Okay. Yeah. Maybe that's the issue then because I'm trying to add it after the fact.

Danielle Velt
Grant, quick question. Are you going to the RFP home screen to create RFP and doing it from there?

Grant Wessel
No. So I'm in the deal page, and then on the right hand side, I'm scrolling down to RFP and then adding from there.

Danielle Velt
Okay. What I would recommend doing so thank you so much for calling this out because I do wanna make sure that I can highlight this for everyone as well before you go ahead and and do the homework. I would recommend just to make it very, very easy on yourself. Let me go back to my example deal here. On the left hand side, click on actions on the deal and then view all properties and go back to that RFP required property, and if you originally set it to no, set it to yes. That will spin up the RFP for you and make sure it's assigned to you, and it does the heavy lifting. It also, is important to do it that way so that, everything is just generated for you. It's a little easier. The RFP number will be generated for you as well.

Grant Wessel
Got it. Okay. I'll give that a try. Thank you. Of course.

Danielle Velt
Maybe we just maybe we just don't give the sales reps the option. That's just the way to do it.

Ashley Marie Suski
But not every an RFP has to go to pricing. It doesn't need the an RFP is only if it needs to go to the pricing team. If it does not need to go to the pricing team, then it would be a no. It's just like, this is the deal that I'm pursuing at this company. So let's just say it's a mini bid. Okay?

Jeremy Schlachet
And it's not a true RFP. It's 30 lane, but someone wants to enter that in because it's a bid they're putting in. They don't wanna use the RFP team. They could still go to quote, and when the RFP tab is, they just have to is RFP required? They would just go to no, and it would still be on the board and quote. It just wouldn't have the RFP. John's team wouldn't get notified that there's a bid that they have to be notified about.

Jeremy Schlachet
Hopefully, that answered the question.

Ashley Marie Suski
So, Lou, try one with an RFP and without, and then you can see what sales is required to enter when it's not an RFP. There's still, like, deal amount and things like that. But if you have feedback on, like, things you'd wanna see that maybe we get into a deal when it's an RFP, let me know your feedback on that.

Hannah Peth
And I'm the owner or deal owner, and I tried to create an RFP off of that deal, but it still it just shows that I can't enter anything. It's all grayed out.

Jeremy Schlachet
I would bet that in this case, Ashley, I bet you there's something to do with the Netsuite ID not pulling in because it wouldn't know where to put the RFP to, I I think that's gonna be a problem.

Ashley Marie Suski
Let me check your permissions, Hannah.

Danielle Velt
I was gonna say, I think we should triple check the permissions on the RFP object first for for the users. Hannah, can you do that for me?

Ashley Marie Suski
Just make sure that. Yeah. I mean, my settings? She should be in a regional management position, so she should be able to see. I'm not I just don't know how to admin that part at the moment. I know. I saw how to add permissions. But.

Hannah Peth
Where would I see what permissions I have in settings?

Ashley Marie Suski
I'm looking for yours right now since I'm not sure where you've checked your personal ones. I just know how to check what each user has.

Ashley Marie Suski
And you.

Jeremy Schlachet
I'm gonna hop it, Danielle. This was great. Thank you so much. This was a a very well done training today. So only 30 more to go. Of.

Danielle Velt
Course. Thank you all again. I forgot I wasn't allowed to tell people how many training sessions are left.

Ashley Marie Suski
So, Hannah, I, yeah, I have you as a regional management user. So I.

Hannah Peth
Think I did something wrong, but I tried to create also from the RFP page that was grayed out, then from the deal, that was grayed out too. Do wanna just pop.

Ashley Marie Suski
Your pop you up on the screen?

Jennifer Cooper
I think they're asking you as well, Hannah, if you are the company owner. So.

Hannah Peth
Maybe it's because I just create hold on. Back.

Hannah Peth
Hold on. Let me go to.

Hannah Peth
Deals here. Maybe I'll just share my screen real quick. Don't make fun of how many tabs I have open.

Ashley Marie Suski
Oh, girl. My tabs have tabs. I cannot. Oh.

Hannah Peth
No. So here, I think this was the Jill that I created.

Hannah Peth
But how would I see if I'm the company owner?

Ashley Marie Suski
So you would have to go to the company. If you on the right hand side are all the things that are connected to this record. But if you were able to already create a deal of for it and you went try and create a new deal. Did you try that already?

Hannah Peth
No. But I can do that.

Ashley Marie Suski
Just try and create a new deal for our company.

Danielle Velt
Ashley, do we know should the majority of folks have specifically the sales manager permission set applied?

Ashley Marie Suski
Most. Yes. But she's a regional one, a regional sales manager.

Danielle Velt
Okay. Yeah. So regional management users. That's the one. Okay. So I I think just at first glance, what the issue may be is that we have we have RFPs we have RFPs set to folks can view their RFPs if they're in that permission set, but not edit. They'd like to be able to edit and create. I think we need to update that to edit. Anna, are you still on? Yes. I am. Okay. Just wanted to, triple check with you and with Ashley. If if we're comfortable with me switching that one permission for sales manager and for regional management users just to make sure that folks can edit their RFPs, I believe that should fix Please put their team's RFPs. Their team's RFPs for editing. Okay. Alright. Let's save that, and then I'll push that save also to sales manager.

Ashley Marie Suski
And they should also be able to view. Yeah. You wanna lock Hannah down as much as possible. Just give me a.

Craig Swain
Yeah. She's She's Yeah. Locked down. Crazy. Before she goes rogue in there. Oh.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Alright. Fantastic. I really appreciate everyone's questions and callouts.

---


Danielle Velt
Being sick. But, no, I got two down right now. Alright. Let's see. Do I have. I have an Anna.

Danielle Velt
And do I have a Danny? Yes. Hello. There she is. There's just so many faces on here. I had to scan through them. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. I know I have a few people.

Ashley Marie Suski
That are not able to join us today. They are traveling for team meetings and things like that. Just your friendly reminder that this is a systems workshop. We are not doing any a systems training. We are not doing any sort of traffics customization or anything special like that. Jenny and Anna are our leaders from a 8, our integration partner. We will take the traffic side on when we roll when we roll it out worldwide.

Danielle Velt
But if you have any questions, please feel free to drop them in the chat.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Awesome. Thanks, Ashley. Hello. Hello, everybody. Good to see you again. I hope you all had a wonderful weekend. Alright. So if we remember, last week, we covered a lot of ground. We had 4 different sessions together, and today is session 5. So we're talking about deal teams and solution design. So we're gonna be doing a little bit of a recap to start of deals terminology and just a little refresher of the deal board and the different functionalities from the deal side of things, and then we are gonna talk through the rest of the stages in the sales pipeline in Hubspot. So looking at a little bit more of the functionality there, a couple of specific customizations.

Danielle Velt
Right? The specific deal stages, we'll we have a credit tab, and we're gonna show what that looks like as well. So we're gonna go through all of those pieces. As always, we're gonna be doing this in a demo format, so I will be sharing my screen. Remember, we are still, going to be using the production environment to go through all of this. So if you'd like to follow along at the same time, please feel free to make sure you're logged in to production as we go through so you can kinda click along. But if it's gonna distract you a little bit more, to follow along, please feel free to do that at a later date. Watch the recording and just watch my screen for now.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I'm gonna share my screen. Alright. So we should be seeing Hubspot up in front of us on our screen here. So remember, what we've been looking at at the start of all of our sessions here is this sample data dashboard, and remember, this is because I've set dashboards as my specific home page inside of Hubspot, and I've set this dashboard as my default dashboard. Dashboard. So, hopefully, you're still seeing the same thing if you're looking to follow along and have it exactly mirror what I have up here in front of me. Alright. So I'm gonna do a really quick recap for us of the new terminology that we learned at the end of last week, and I'm gonna first take us over to our deals just so we can see that up in front of us.

Danielle Velt
So remember, we have our bookmarks up at the very top here. I've put my bookmarks back to the way that they were during our last session. So you should have deals bookmarked here. But if not, remember you can go into the CRM booklet card on the left hand side here and then click on deals to get there, or alternatively and probably, a little more efficiently, you can go to your sales workspace. So either from bookmarks or if you go all the way down to the sales funnel icon and then click on sales workspace, you're gonna see the same exact deal board either way and those same functionalities. But in this case, I'm looking at my individual sales workspace, and I can click on deals to then see that same deal board.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So if we remember from last week, a deal is our potential sale with a dollar amount attached. This is where we track the revenue in the pipeline. This is where we can create RFPs and quotes. A lot of times, we're we're intertwining those things. We're maybe associating those things together, and deals progress through stages inside of a pipeline. So a deal pipeline in Hubspot, it's the process that all of our deals go through from the creation of that deal through to being either won or lost, and these deal stages that we see in front of us so we talked last week about discovery end quote, and now we're gonna talk about the remaining stages that we see to the right here.

Danielle Velt
These are all the milestones that a deal goes through on its journey to being ultimately won or lost. So, again, last week in session 4, we discussed how to create a deal, and we also talked about the discovery and quote stages being those first two stages in the sales pipeline. I'm gonna quickly recap deal creation for us just so we can remember how to do that if we're ever manually creating a deal in Hubspot. So we want to be on this deal board. So, one quick thing as well, if you're not seeing the board view initially, if for some reason you're seeing the list view of all your deals and you wanna change that to see the same view, remember that right next to the search bar here of all of my deals, I can click where it says board view or table view and make sure that I'm looking at the correct view that I want.

Danielle Velt
Remember, you do have these extra views as well. You can view deals in a reporting sense, a Gantt chart, or a calendar view. But for simplicity's sake and for what's probably going to be the most helpful for new users in Hubspot, we're gonna stay on table view or board view here. But for deals specifically, I'm gonna keep us on this board view, and up in the top right, this is where we can add deals. So if I click on add deals and then create new, this is how I can manually create a new deal in the system. Remember that if you're looking at a contact record or a company record in Hubspot, on the right hand side of that record, you can also create a new deal from there.

Danielle Velt
You'll see a little deal section, and there will be that plus add button. So as I go to create a new deal, if I'm doing it just from this deal section, I need to give the deal a name. So I could say, this is my in this example, this is my demo deal. But oftentimes, best practice is to include either the contact and or company name that you're going to be associating to this deal so that you know who it's for, then we wanna make sure we're selected on the right pipeline because we do have several here. We're gonna talk more about the pop pipeline tomorrow. But for now, we're staying selected on sales pipeline, and then we should automatically be defaulted to the first stage of whatever pipeline we choose.

Danielle Velt
But just make sure that for the sales pipeline, it's discovery, and then I need to enter an amount. So whatever my projected amount is, that will close for this deal. I need to select the deal type. So is this new business existing pop or quick sale? I'm gonna say new business for my example. I have to select the service line as well or multiple. So let's say it's LTL and truckload, but we have a lot of different options here, and then I can choose my deal team. So deal team is a little bit different than deal owner, although they both pull from the users inside of your Hubspot account. So for deal team, I could say junior and Jonathan are on my team for this deal, so I want them to have access to look at this deal.

Danielle Velt
But I'm ultimately the deal owner, so I can keep myself defaulted here as the deal owner. If I have an idea of what the close date is going to be, I can set that here. Remember that any asterisk that you see next to the name of the field is required. But in this case, in our deal creation form close date, deal owner and priority are technically not required, and then I need to choose if an RFP is required. Remember, we talked about the RFP process last week. For now, I'm gonna say no just because we already covered that process, we're just gonna be looking at deals, and then this is where I can associate records. So sometimes you might find it, a little more convenient to create the deal from the company record or from the contact record so that you don't even have to select the company or contact from this deal creation form. But if I need to, I can choose from right here, and I could search for my company right here and search for my contact.

Danielle Velt
And then I can click on create, and then that brings me straight into my deal record, and we probably remember this format. Right? We learned a lot last week about all of the things that we can do on these different records, whether it's a contact company deal or RFP. We have the basic information up in the top left here. So the the name of the deal, the amount, close date, pipeline deal stage, all of the core pieces, and then we have our sales activity buttons that are really quick and easy and helpful, and then we have information on the deal right here. But if you are not seeing specific fields right in front of you that you need to see here, we can click on actions and then view all properties, and you can see those properties here and search for them dynamically to find what is the current value or was there a previous value that was then set differently, etcetera.

Danielle Velt
If you would like to actually customize your view here, so this would not change the way this looks for everyone, you can click on actions, customize properties, and you can add properties to your own view as it says right here. So Hubspot will remind you that changes will only show for you. So if you'd like to do that, you can on the contact company deal or RFP level, any of those record levels, and again, it's not going to disrupt anybody else's view there, and on the right hand side, we have our Breeze record summary. Remember, this is powered by Hubspot AI. So it's just trying to give you a summary of and and analyze all of the different activities, the field values that are set on this deal to try to give you the most up to date understanding of where this deal is at, and then we have associations.

Danielle Velt
So who is the contact or who are the contacts that are associated here, and same with companies, and any other applicable record types here, and in our center pane, we're always going to see the overview and the activities. So we have recent activities. If Hubspot powers a deal score or insights here for us, we'll see the same associations on the right hand side as in the center here if we scroll down, and then our activities. Right? We can filter our activity right in the center here to see all of the possible activities and events or actions that can happen to this deal, and so I can see now that I've created this deal, it has gone through a few of those workflow automations that, I think we mentioned very early on that a workflow is just automation where, something happens in Hubspot.

Danielle Velt
Right? There's a trigger action, and then that makes something else automatically happen in the system for you. Alright. I'm gonna pause here because I did a lot of talking, in terms of recapping that some of the things we've already learned so far. Do we have any big questions at the moment that have come through the chat, or does anybody need to hand raise?

Danielle Velt
Alright. Fantastic. Okay. I'm going to bring us back out to all of our deals. So up in the top left, I can click on back to deals, and we're gonna talk a little bit about, just very briefly, about the other functionalities we have here to, again, keep getting familiar with these things. So remember, when we're on this board view, we can only view one pipeline at a time. Right? It's going it's going to restrict you from viewing all pipelines so that that should be grayed out, and that is because each of the pipelines that we have for deals in Hubspot can and likely will have different deal stages. Right? So we can only visualize one deal pipeline at a time, and then all of the same functionality that that we've talked about with contact and company home pages still applies here.

Danielle Velt
So we have the dynamic search bar here for different deal names so I can search for for example, I'm looking at one specific deal here. So where are my Curtis Tate, deals that I need to see? I can also drag different columns. So if I leave the board view and go over to my table view, this is where I can drag and drop my different columns if I need to see things in a different order here. I can also edit the columns that I see. So up next to where it says table view, click on edit columns, that button there, and I can add any specific columns that I want to see. So you can search for them here.

Danielle Velt
So if I wanted to see, for instance, the create date of my deal, I can check that box. It'll show up on the right hand side here, and I can drag and drop anything that I wanna see here and then click apply, and then we can also use quick filters and advanced filters. So remember, right underneath the search bar, these are our quick filters here. So if I just wanted to see my deals, we have a very nice me filter here. I can also search based on the create date of last week. Right? So now it's pairing down the data that I'm seeing because I'm adding all of these filters. I can x them out at any time if I don't need to see certain filters, and then we have advanced filters.

Danielle Velt
So this just means that the filters are a little more tucked away, but they're still applied. But remember that you can essentially put an or in between the criteria when it comes to advanced filters. So I could say deal stage is any of discovery in the sales pipeline, or let's say, close date is, this month. Right? So that's a little bit different than our quick filters where there's an implied and in between any quick filters that you apply here, and with advanced filters, you can get a little more truly advanced here and put ors in between or put ands in between. So there's different groupings of criteria, and again, I can clear that at any time using that x, and I can create new views or view existing views.

Danielle Velt
Right? So up at the top here, you're actually seeing different views that I have pulled up. So I have my deals. It's just showing me my information. I can see Canada group if there's anything there, Mexico group, US group. Right? There's specific views based on specific groups, then I can go back to all deals, and at any time, I can choose on the very right hand side here to clone the existing view so that I can create my new view.

Danielle Velt
Right? So it's gonna give kind of a temporary name here, and I can say this is my new view or whatever I need to call it, and then I can click the checkbox, and then I could apply filters from here. So maybe it's close date is this month, and deal owner is me. So I'm in my new view, and now I need to save the filters I just applied. So on the very right hand side, I'm gonna save my edits, and that's my view. So if I have this shared with everybody, everybody can see this. I can choose these 3 dots icon right here, and I can manage sharing or rename this at any time or even delete it, and if I manage sharing, remember, you can make it private, shared with your team, or everyone, and then as we know, we can make in line edits.

Danielle Velt
So if I actually wanted to just push a deal to the next stage here, change the owner, I'm gonna see the option to do all of those things. Some of these dates, such as the create date, may or may not be able to be edited. It depends on if it's a field in Hubspot that is able to be edited by a user. It should be able to edit the closed date if I need to push it out, etcetera, and remember, we can bulk update deals as well. So if I click on the checkbox right here, I'm gonna see a new bar pop out to be able to edit a specific property value here or delete these deals if applicable, create tasks for them, etcetera, and remember, we can also sort.

Danielle Velt
So if I click on the sort button towards the top right, I can sort based on close date here as well. Right? If I'm already filtering for it, fantastic. But I can sort by I wanna see the oldest or most recent close date. Alright. I'm gonna bring us back to all deals, and we are gonna go back to our board view here, and remember, we can move deals to the next stage by dragging and dropping. I'm actually gonna clean up this board a little bit just so that we're looking at only my deals, and remember, we can drag and drop. So let's say we're ready to go from quote to the solution design deal stage here. So I can drag the deal here.

Danielle Velt
Remember, sometimes we have what are called dependent properties. This is also known as required properties, and remember also that property and field, these are interchangeable words in Hubspot. So if I say field, it also means property and vice versa. So if we want to be able to drop this deal into the solution design stage, I just need to fill out a few, properties here or fields. So I need to enter what is my estimated transportation spend, total yearly volume, pain points, and again, for some of these, they might be drop downs or multi select. So I can select what I need to here. A proposal date. What is my estimated close date? Maybe I need to change that value if I see what it currently is.

Danielle Velt
I need to upload a file here. So let's say. I have a file that I can add here, and then it gives me an option to update my deal team if I need to, remember when I created the deal, I had set specific users on my team that are my deal team, and then I can click apply, and now I'm progressed into the solution design stage. So this is where we are doing internals you know, excuse me, internal design and validation of how Traffix will service the business. So, again, there's required fields to be able to fill out here. Once we get to the proposal stage, right, let's say we're ready to move to that stage, we can again do a drag and drop or on the record itself.

Danielle Velt
I can choose the stage drop down and then choose proposal, and all I need to choose as a dependent property here for the proposal stage is an estimated decision date. So let's say that's actually January one. I can click apply, and now I'm officially moved into that stage as well. So it's a similar process as far as we go through all of the different stages, and as we go to negotiation, right, we have another couple of quick fields here. One thing to note though, it is best practice if these are whether these are required or recommended fields for you to fill out. Just be aware that the reason that fields may be surfaced to you that are not required is because we want you to be thinking of them at this point in the deal process.

Danielle Velt
Right? So, hopefully, at this point, we know our payment terms, and we can upload an agreement. If we can't, though, these are not required. Remember, there is no asterisk here. So it's recommended, not required at this point in the process, and I can click apply. So now that we're at negotiation, negotiation, our customer is reviewing the proposal and negotiating final numbers, and actually, at this point so this is when we can actually open that credit tab on the company record. So if I come into my deal.

Danielle Velt
And remember, again, you can push the deal stage forward from right here as well on the left hand side. That side that same sidebar that we saw from the deal homepage will still pop out from the right hand side for you to fill out any required fields. But at this point so this is this, sorry. Is this in the sandbox or real? This is in production.

Jeremy Schlachet
Okay. Can you scroll down the left hand side really quick?

Danielle Velt
Yes.

Jeremy Schlachet
I don't think you have a credit tab because we don't have a Netsuite number.

Danielle Velt
Oh, so I I was just about to mention, we're gonna go to the company record to see that credit tab.

Jeremy Schlachet
This is the deal one. Yes.

Danielle Velt
This is the deal.

Jeremy Schlachet
Yes. Yes. Thank you. Sorry.

Danielle Velt
About that. Yes. I was.

Jeremy Schlachet
So you can only request that's a good point, though. You can only request credit from the company, not the deal.

Danielle Velt
Yes. So now that we're at the negotiation stage of the deal, what I want to do and the reason we clicked into this deal record is the easiest way for us to get to that remember that associated company record that we have is by clicking into the deal, and then on the right hand side, we wanna come to this company section, click on the company record, and this is where we should be seeing the credit tab. One thing I want to call out and stress here. So, yes, this is going to be, Netsuite dependent. Just be aware of that. We do need to have a company owner assigned on this company record and a Trafix customer ID that will sync over from Netsuite. So those two things have to be true in Hubspot for you to then have visibility into the credit tab.

Jeremy Schlachet
So yes. There won't so traffics if there's no the the Netsuite call, I guess, is pretty would what is it? Every 5 minutes we thought that was right to that Netsuite and Hubspot will be communicating? Honestly.

Augie Picado
I'm not exactly sure if it's fine. 15 right now.

Jeremy Schlachet
It's 15 minutes. Okay. So if someone has.

Ashley Marie Suski
A question 3 g and Netsuite.

Jeremy Schlachet
That's the same time. Great. So there shouldn't be any delays.

Jeremy Schlachet
Alright.

Danielle Velt
Perfect. Yes. So we are essentially getting that information from Hubspot into Netsuite, and at that point, again, it's on specifically the company record. You should be able to see that credit tab. If you would like to demo this right now on your side, you can either, click into this specific company record inside of production, or you should be able to based on the homework from last week. Right? We had everybody create kind of their own, demo company record just to play around with. You can set the company owner. The company owner will likely already be set to yourself, and you can set just a, any value, any inputted value to the traffic's customer ID property. So remember, under this primary section, I can click on actions, view all properties.

Danielle Velt
If I search for Trafx customer ID, I just entered for now 12345 just to make sure that I can see the credit tab and that that pops up for me. So in the interim, while, we're not having the active, data flow to that field from Netsuite, you can do that just so that you can see this credit tab.

Jeremy Schlachet
Danielle, would anybody be able to request credit? So if there's an account manager associated to this, would they have the same rights to request credit, or does it have to be the salesperson?

Danielle Velt
Actually, Anna, do wanna go check me on this one?

Anastasia Zhukova
If they have access to the company, they would be able to, request credit check.

Augie Picado
And, Jeremy, even with a core license, we checked on that with junior. So, yes, they can.

Jeremy Schlachet
Great. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. So, yes, what we're gonna be seeing here is our credit check management. So we can always see the status here. What is the credit limit? What are what are the payment terms, the life cycle, and the expiry date, and we wanna understand if this is a standard sale or a quick sale. Right? So right now, we're gonna stay discussing standard sale, but you can also perform a quick sale as well. So if I need to do a standard sale, I can say I want to send for credit checking. This is going to then bring me to a high radius page where I can fill out the information. Right? So it's gonna show me what are what are all of the pieces of information that I need to enter here.

Danielle Velt
So customer ID, company name, sales rep name, etcetera, and then I can either do a quick save or click next, and again, it's actually a similar UI here even though this is not a Hubspot page in particular. Anything with an asterisk is required. Anything without an asterisk, is not required. But as soon as I go through these pieces, I will officially have sent this for, the credit check. So for now, I'm gonna go back to my previous screen, and it will tell you that you have successfully sent for credit checking as well.

Danielle Velt
And, actually, yes, we should be seeing success up at the top, whether it's the form has been opened or we have submitted, and once Netsuite actually returns credit approved and Hubspot Hubspot will then receive the customer active status. So we've talked a lot about company status. We should be in customer active at that point, which would then automatically move our deal. Remember on the right hand side, the deal that we've been working on, that deal should automatically, move to the credit complete stage for us, which then will create a pop deal to begin that pop process, and again, we're gonna talk more about the pop process tomorrow. One big thing to be aware of here is that a deal cannot move backwards in the sales pipeline to a previous stage once it has moved to credit complete and also closed won.

Danielle Velt
So the closed won stage, if I come back to my deal. I'm gonna bring us all the way back to my deal here just to show the visual here. So let's say I've been automatically moved to credit complete on this deal. Fantastic. I should be locked from moving this deal backwards to a previous stage. Right? So the previous stages are negotiation, proposal, solution design, quote, and discovery. You're gonna see on my screen that it says you can bypass the rule the pipeline rule set here. That is for super admins only. So just be aware. I have I have those permissions, the elevated admin permissions right now. Your user likely should not be seeing that. So just be aware.

Danielle Velt
It should restrict you from moving backwards, and then I can move to closed one from credit complete. So this is when the deal has ultimately been, either, in this case, one, but one or lost if we're moving to closed lost. So I can say, yes. Credit has been approved and survey recipients have been added, and then add my award document if I have it, and then I can save, and again, credit complete and closed one are the only stages here that we should not be able to move backwards from. I can also just move to closed loss, and closed loss can happen at almost any point in time in the deal stage process. Right? I could be only at proposal or negotiation, and then I could realize, okay. This this deal has actually been lost, and so I need to drop it down to close lost, and at that point, the only required field here will be close lost reason. So I could say maybe it's pricing and then save.

Jeremy Schlachet
If we're try I I'm trying to I'm going through this and following you. I've got 3 companies. Two of them are actual real companies. It's saying that the Netsuite sync status is excluded from sync, so it's never putting in the number, and I and I don't have rights to manually type in a number like you did for the assigning. Is that just that we something with the sync that got messed up when we did this, or is that a common error?

Danielle Velt
Oh, Jeremy. Sorry. Just to clarify, it's it's not allowing you to enter the traffic's customer ID value?

Jeremy Schlachet
Yeah. It's it won't let me do that at all.

Danielle Velt
Okay, and I actually, if you wanna double check me on this as well, I think it sounds like that field when we when we officially go live with Netsuite, it should likely be cut off from anyone adding their own number in. Right? Because it is syncing from Netsuite to Hubspot.

Anastasia Zhukova
Yeah. Is correct. Let me check on the backend right now if that is in place already.

Danielle Velt
Okay.

Augie Picado
And, Jeremy, that sync process with Netsuite, it's still only connected to sandbox. We were testing it today. We talked about it this afternoon. Hopefully, we'll be shortly ready to do that in production.

Jeremy Schlachet
And that's why. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I'm gonna bring us back to our deal board here. We're gonna quickly recap a couple of our, the previous functionality that we talked about towards the end of last week when we had talked about discovery and quote. So if we remember, in our board view, we have some really quick and easy buttons here, and this is why I would recommend using the board view as you're working through deals, and actually, I'm gonna bring us back into the sales workspace. So remember, either go to your bookmarks or to the sales hub section, which is this funnel icon to get over to the sales workspace, and then I'm gonna click on the deals section, and now I'm gonna look at my deals.

Danielle Velt
So from here, remember, we can either click on the name of the deal to go into this deal record, and I can also see the amount, close date, deal owner, and create date. So these are just some basic pieces of information about the deal that I may need to see at a glance. If I click anywhere on this card other than the name of the deal, I can see the preview on the right hand side. So it's trying to kind of condense everything you could possibly need to see on the right hand side about this record without actually having to go into this deal. So remember the name, all the basic information. You have all of your quick sales activity buttons here.

Danielle Velt
So if you need to leave a note, send a one to one email, make a call, leave a task, leave a meeting, or schedule a meeting here, and remember, we are later this week going to talk about calling with Dialpad, so just keep that in the back of your mind. This calling feature is specifically at the moment for Hubspot calling, but we'll talk about Dialpad calling, and then you can also click on more. So if you needed to log any of these actions that may have happened outside of Hubspot and you just need to make sure that they are also accounted for inside of Hubspot. So we have our brief record summary, all the information about the deal, and again, you can update these pieces of information if you need to, you'll see any pinned activities, recent activities, upcoming, etcetera.

Danielle Velt
Right? These are all the things that we already saw on the deal record, any associations, and I can x out of that preview, and then if I come back to this deal card, I'm gonna see the names of the contacting company, all the different records that are associated between contacts and companies to this deal, and I will also be able to click on the preview button from right here. It brings me back into that sidebar preview, and then there's other quick buttons here. Right? Do I want Breeze to give me a quick summary? So this is, again, pulling up essentially your Hubspot Chatgpt, to give you some basic information and a rundown of this record. I can create an email from right here, so that'll give me my pop up to send an email to the contact that's associated to the deal.

Danielle Velt
I can leave a note. So, again, these actions are still going to be logged to the deal record even though you're not fully clicked into it, which is very convenient, and then I could even create a quote if I were using Hubspot quoting specifically. Alright, and as we work through deals, of course, we are likely to have tasks. Right? There are specific tasks, whether they be on the contact record, the company record, or the deal record itself. At any point in time, I could click on my tasks tab, and if we remember, I had some specific tasks. I probably have a lot that are overdue since last week. So I can see right here what is the current status.

Danielle Velt
If I know that I've already done this task, I can click the checkbox here. It's gonna highlight it green and tell me, great. You've finished this task. That's wonderful. Do we want to right away create a follow up task? So if I do want that, I could say, great. I'm gonna set what I want the due date to be. Maybe that's 3 business days from now, maybe at towards the middle of the day, and then I can say create task. If I don't want that, I could choose not now, and then that task is completed. Remember, though, that the most efficient way for us to go through all of our tasks is to make sure that we have the right task view in front of us.

Danielle Velt
So if you would like to start with your overdue tasks, which I would say is kind of a general recommendation, is to go based on the task due date, you could do that. You could say, I'm gonna go through all of my overdue, then I'm gonna go through everything that's due today, and then if I can get ahead, I'll go through everything that's upcoming. But you can also create your own saved views. So last week, I had created this email to dos saved view because I only wanted to see my tasks that had the email task type because I just wanted to go through and be able to send a lot of different emails, and that that filter is indicated in the advanced filter section here.

Danielle Velt
So I I wanna see all tasks that are not completed, that are assigned to me, and that have a task type of email, and so from here or from any of these views on the left hand side, I can click on start all on the right hand side, and then remember, this brings me into my task queue. So I know that I'm in my task queue when I see this white bar up at the top here. So it tells me the name of the task, and on the right hand side, do I need to reschedule this, skip it, or have I completed it, and then if I want to not only skip to the next task, but skip to for example, so I'm looking at demo task one right now.

Danielle Velt
It would take me to number 8 next and then number 9 and then number 5 because it's going top to bottom. I could just skip all the way to number 5 right now if I wanted to, so very nice that you can progress forward in the task queue if you know that you need to skip something, and because it's an email task type, remember, Hubspot is gonna be smart enough here to pull up the email window for you right away. So it's really important to think about, is this an email task, is this a call task versus just a general to do?

Danielle Velt
And at any time, can go back to the sales workspace using the button up in the top left here, and remember, you can also access your tasks and even more information from the summary page. Right? So I can start my tasks right from this little tasks section underneath the CRM quick links, and it's breaking it out for me just in a high summary. Right? So it's telling me here's all my tasks. Is anything due today? Is anything overdue? Is anything due tomorrow? Etcetera. So I could go into my task queue from here as well. Alright. I'm gonna pause here. What questions do we have? What can we answer?

Danielle Velt
Yep. Curtis.

Curtis Tate
If on the company record, say you have, like, you know, your primary account manager filled out, is that gonna give that account manager visibility to all the deals on that company file, or do you have to still manually add them into each deal that you create?

Danielle Velt
So because the account manager will be added to a what's called a user field inside of Hubspot, same as the sales rep. Right? They're both called user fields. So it's pulling from all the users that are in Hubspot Being assigned to a user field, whether it's the sales rep field or the account manager field, that gives them access to that specific record.

Danielle Velt
Let me know if we have any follow up questions, though, or if I can elaborate any further.

Curtis Tate
I imagine that the, you know, records being imported or migrated over from Netsuite, the previous deal teams in place are being transitioned, or is that something we're gonna have to clean up internally and as a sales rep, we add our RAMs to those?

Jeremy Schlachet
We're doing a fresh restart, Curtis. Every account's up from the air. So if you could better be on at 5AM that day, you could grab active customers and put them in your name.

Danielle Velt
Alright.

Augie Picado
Curtis, I would like to answer that seriously.

Danielle Velt
Go ahead, Augie.

Augie Picado
No. Listen. We were on our call earlier today, and we are confirming the updated deal file that will be coming over from. Netsuite over to Hubspot. So we're in the process of doing that. So that'll all get moved over with all the current assignments.

Ashley Marie Suski
I am, just so you know, unsure about certain deals and account managers that currently have those open. So as a takeaway, after I see what the final environment looks like, your homework might be as a sales rep. Hey. Go check any open deals you have and make sure your account manager is tagged on it. Just their homework will be to practice using it, but doing stuff that they would actually be doing. So alright.

Danielle Velt
What other questions do we have? Whether it's related to deals and more, excuse me, more information about deals that we talked about today or if it's about anything we've covered in our past session so far.

Danielle Velt
Anna and Ashley, let me know if anything big has come through chat as well.

Anastasia Zhukova
We are good in chat.

Danielle Velt
Amazing. Everybody's learning. Lovely. We're all feeling feeling a little more confident with the system. Alright. If we don't have any questions either from prior sessions that we're still wondering about or anything we've covered so far today, I do wanna take the opportunity with the time that we still have here to start talking about dashboards a bit. So we're gonna pivot our our brains a little bit to talk about dashboards and reporting. We're gonna go through this even more in our final session, but I do wanna get us started on this topic especially because we are going to be talking a little bit more about dial pad calling on session 7 as well. So we're just switching a couple of things around to make sure that we can cover all of that ground.

Danielle Velt
So. I'm gonna bring us over to our home page here. So in the top left, we're gonna click on that Hubspot icon, and remember, this whole time, we have had this sample data dashboard in front of us. So this was my default. I want to bring us to a different dashboard just so that we can use some filters and really start to understand some of the data that we're seeing in front of us. But the first thing I'm gonna do, as we've been doing, right, we're because we're talking about new terminology here, and sometimes different systems may not describe these words the same way as Hubspot. So a dashboard in Hubspot is specifically related to reporting. A dashboard holds a collection of reports.

Danielle Velt
Right? So this sample data, dashboard is a collection of different reports. It has report number one, report two, report 3, etcetera, directly on this dashboard. One report can be on multiple dashboards. So they can be kind of independent from each other, and you can delete a report, and that will delete it from the system and from a dashboard or multiple dashboards. So we just need to be aware of that, and you can also have a report that doesn't live on a dashboard. So we would look at those reports in a different area of Hubspot. But we're gonna start just by talking a little bit about dashboards so that we can understand and navigate through this as needed.

Danielle Velt
So if we did not have dashboards as our home page here, as I do, where you would find dashboards is at the very bottom of your sidebar navigation. We see this little bar chart icon. This is our reporting section. So if, as I mentioned a second ago, if you have a report that you've created or someone else has created, and it's not on a dashboard, you would wanna come to the reporting section and then click on reports. I do wanna briefly mention this and just give us a little snapshot. So, if we're, again, just looking for a report and maybe it's not on the dashboard. Right? So under this dashboard section, it might actually say zero. I can still see the report itself from right here.

Danielle Velt
So, again, it's not on a dashboard, but I still have access to see that report right here. I'm gonna head back though away from that visualization. So this is a great spot if you are just looking for the name of a specific report to be able to search that up in the top left here. Search for the name of that report, or even sort by the names of reports could make it easier to find what you're looking for. You should be able to see the owner, who it's assigned to, etcetera. It's going to depend slightly on your permissions as far as reporting goes. We may not have the ability to create new reports as, sales manager users or sales rep users.

Danielle Velt
Right, and in some cases, you might. It's going to depend on your permission set, so just keep that in mind here that you may or may not see exactly what I'm seeing here, based on whether you just have view permissions for reporting and dashboards or full editing capabilities here. Alright. I'm gonna bring us over to dashboards because this will be more universal for everyone whether you have just view access or view and edit. So if we come over to the reporting section, we can click on dashboards, and it's going to bring you to a default dashboard of some sort. You can set a different default dashboard, and we'll talk about how to do that in a second. But right now, I'm gonna click on the name of where it says sample data because that's the name of the current dashboard that I'm looking at. Let's say that I want to actually look at.

Danielle Velt
Actually, let's not do our load dashboard. Let's look at let's look at leadership dashboard.

Danielle Velt
So for right now, we're not going to look at the very specific data that we see in the report. We're just looking at the functionality and how we navigate and move through reporting and dashboards. So in this drop down, you should be able to see a few different dashboards that you have at least view access into, and remember, this feature works very similarly to the saved views that we've been talking about on contact company and deal levels and the RFP level as well. You can make a dashboard completely private, but remember, that's if you have editing capabilities to create a new dashboard and put reports on it. So there could be additional reports that maybe someone has made private to themselves.

Danielle Velt
But anything that is shared with your team or shared with everyone or that you have created, if you have the permissions to do so, will appear in this drop down for you to select as a dashboard that you want to look at. So now I'm on this dashboard. On the right hand side, I can do a few things. So regardless of whether you have view or also edit access, I can click on actions, and I should be able to select set as default because maybe I want this leadership dashboard to be my default dashboard. So now I'm seeing that default icon right here. So you can change that at any time. I can remove it as my default by going to the exact same section under actions there.

Danielle Velt
Some of these capabilities may be locked down to edit only. So, again, this is gonna be based on your permissions, but you may be able to clone this dashboard. In that case, it will ask if you want to clone just, the dashboard with the current reports on it or if you want to make a clone of all the reports that are on the dashboard. So there's different options here. You can see your dashboard detail details as well. So who is the owner? What's the name? Is there a description here? Etcetera. I can also see an activity log. So if I need to see on maybe on the ops side who's edited this dashboard, you can also go into full screen view.

Danielle Velt
This will be accessible even if you only have view access. You should be able to make it full screen for yourself. So if you want to see the data a little bit larger on your screen and cut out the noise, I can press the escape button on my keyboard to get away from full screen, and if you have edit access to whatever dashboard you're looking at, you can delete the dashboard itself. Please be very cautious with this if you have the permissions to do so. You can delete a dashboard and the reports it contains, or you can just delete the dashboard, in which case the reports still exist. They might just be in that reporting section that we just looked at.

Danielle Velt
Right? It might be reports without a dashboard home at the moment. So just be very careful there. If you have dashboard creation access, you'll see the create dashboard button or the manage dashboard section here. You can also share a dashboard by copying the URL. So this will work if somebody else, also is a Hubspot user and you wanna send them the URL to this dashboard via Microsoft Teams chat. Right? So it'll open up for them, or you could choose to email the dashboard. So I could say, want to send the data in this dashboard right now, the snapshot of it in an email, and you can choose what you want the subject and the message to be, how many reports to include, etcetera, and you can even make it a recurring email.

Danielle Velt
So if this is something that you want to see in your inbox every Monday morning at 8AM in your time zone, that is something you could do. So very convenient, and if you have edit access, you should also see the add content button. So I could add another report to this dashboard. You can add image or text, which is a bit newer, and external content as well. So if you needed to, for example, I think a good a good example of this is, if you see any reports on a dashboard that say, maybe they're, powered by, Power BI, then that is a good example of maybe external content that we're loading into this dashboard, and you can create a new report if you have editing permissions as well, and on the top left, this is one of the most important things.

Danielle Velt
Whether you even if you just have view access, if you're being asked to look at a particular dashboard, maybe it's just of individual metrics of your own, we need to be able to understand how to use the quick filters and the advanced filters. They work pretty much exactly the same as what we already learned. Right? We did all the heavy lifting to learn on contacts, companies, deals, RFPs, how to use quick filters versus advanced filters on that home page. So for the quick filters, Hubspot gives you what's called dynamic quick filters. So right away, it's going to say the most popular quick filters are typically the date range that you wanna see for the reports in this dashboard, the owners.

Danielle Velt
So remember, you are you are a deal owner. You are a company owner. You can be a contact owner. So that's really what Hubspot is trying to get you to be able to filter by very easily, or even you can filter by team. Maybe you wanna see your entire team's data. So I wanna see in in the deal report that's on this dashboard. I wanna see just the deals that everybody on my team owns if I'm a sales manager, for example. So if I wanted to filter this dashboard just by myself, I could click on the owner's quick filter, and I need to select an operator. We've seen this before. Right? Sometimes it's is any of, is none of, is known, or is unknown.

Danielle Velt
In this case, I want is any of, and then I want to choose me, and then I can click apply, and the data on the dashboard should automatically reload. So this top, report, again, even though the data is just dummy data at the moment, we did see it reload because maybe there isn't data for my user at this very moment in time. But it is still going to auto refresh every couple of minutes for you. But also when you make a change to the filters, everything will refresh for you. I can x that out at any time. I could even put multiple owners here. So if I wanted to do is any of, I could choose myself and my teammates and then click apply, or again, I could just filter by teams.

Danielle Velt
So, again, is any of, and then I can choose based on my team or my branch. So the way we're seeing this structure show up, this is based on our team structure and the team hierarchy in our Hubspot instance. So we just wanna be aware of that here as well. You can select multiple teams or just yours. I can also choose to remove it as a quick filter. So I just did that by clicking on remove. I can also choose to re add either of these or both of them. So if I also want a date range, I just added that here. I could say date range is and then it'll give me a lot of different options here.

Danielle Velt
Right? The date range options should be very, very similar, if not the same throughout our full Hubspot UI. Right? So I could say maybe I wanna see only data in all of these reports from last quarter. So all of these filters are applying to every single report on this dashboard, and then I still have the ability to do advanced filters. So if I click here, it kind of in the center at the top here, I can click on advanced filters. I'm gonna see my sidebar pop out. We have the choice here again to either tuck away our filters or we could add additional quick filters. So this is where our Hubspot UI differs slightly. Right? When we were on the home pages for our different objects for contacts, companies, deals, We saw the more button, and that allowed us to add a quick filter.

Danielle Velt
I can choose this quick filter section in the sidebar and add a new quick filter from here. So this is the equivalent of that more button that we were seeing on those other pages. So I could say choose another quick filter. Maybe I want to see amount as a quick filter, so I'm choosing the amount field on the deal level, and then I have to click customize, and I can actually give it a different label. I would recommend as best practice just to not confuse everyone that might be using this dashboard to try to mirror the name of the field. So in this case, I want to keep this as close date, but you can technically give it a custom label, and then I can choose save and x out of this, and now I have closed date here.

Danielle Velt
So, again, what I just did was the equivalent of just clicking more and adding a new quick filter here. So I can say, date is less than oh, actually, let me say. I'll say is equal to and then click apply. So, again, it's reloading the data for me as needed, and we can also add the same sort of filters just in the advanced filters if I really wanted to tuck it away. So close date is this week. Apply filter, and then I could add even more filters here. If I wanted to filter for branch, for example, it's very easy to click through and choose what I need, and then click apply.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Just checking the time here. I wanna give us some space in a second here that with these next few minutes, just see if we have any initial questions on reporting and dashboards, how this functionality works. Again, we're gonna talk a little bit more about this, especially in session 7 towards the end of this week. We wanted to give us a little intro right now.

Danielle Velt
Any burning questions with our last few minutes here?

Danielle Velt
Everyone's like, I know this UI at this point. I'm an expert.

Tony Pomocnik
I guess my only and that's not really a question, but I don't have access to the filtering or anything like that for the dashboard, for any of the, reports there. Is that done on purpose, or is that, just me?

Danielle Velt
Oh, that's a good callout. I was gonna say, Anna, if you wanna help take this one because this will all come back. It it will all come back to our permissions in production.

Tony Pomocnik
Yeah. It's just grayed out. It's there. It's just grayed out saying that it can't be applied to any of the reports.

Anastasia Zhukova
Yes. So.

Augie Picado
Okay. Oh, yeah. Go go ahead. I'm sorry, Anna. Ashley and I literally were going through this this afternoon. We updated all the permissions, I don't know, 3 hours ago, and I actually think this is one of the ones that we know we had off that we turned on. So great that you brought it up. Perfect timing. So it's off because in our first passing the permissions, we had them off because we didn't necessarily want everybody out there kind of mucking around, creating their own dashboards, but we're kind of reconsidering that. We'll have standard dashboards. If you guys wanna create your own, that's gonna be on. I'm not sure when we're gonna upload those. We did send that file over to a 8 earlier today. So that will be getting turned on, Tony.

Tony Pomocnik
Alright. No. Not a problem. Just making sure it wasn't just a meeting.

Ashley Marie Suski
Great question.

Danielle Velt
Any other burning questions while we're waiting? I have a couple minutes left here.

Danielle Velt
Double check me. Anna and Ashley, is there anything in the chat that we haven't addressed? I'm sure sounds like we're caught up.

Anastasia Zhukova
We're all set in the chat as well.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Awesome. Ashley, let me know if we if we wanna cover anything in our last couple minutes here, if we wanna give everyone a couple minutes back.

Ashley Marie Suski
It is I just didn't or it's Hanukkah. It is an early Christmas gift. Enjoy your two minutes. You deserve it. You've earned it. We will see everyone not tomorrow. Unless you come to the optional train the trainer, we will see you on Wednesday. We're off tomorrow for this. Have two more sessions left, and the link was sent out from the LMS. Yay. I'm gonna drop it in here as well.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Awesome.

---


Ashley Marie Suski
It was with a customer, and Sean Collins came by. It was nice. Nice to manage. So Jim and I had to open on Friday mornings, and I had to be there at 04:30AM, and I would literally sleep in the clothes I was gonna wear to work because there was just I couldn't do it. I am not a morning person, so I just get ready the day before, wake up, and brush my teeth and gum. It was the worst.

Ashley Marie Suski
Alright. Let's see. We have a few people. I know we have a couple people that can't make today's because they're traveling in with customers, but they are watching the recording. Yay. We have only two left to go. This is so exciting.

Ashley Marie Suski
Alright, Danny. Take it away, girlfriend.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Thanks, Ashley. Hello again, everybody. Great to see you. I hope you're having a wonderful Thursday. Alright. So this is session 6, and today, we are going to be talking about the POP process. So we're talking about requesting credit, engaging the POP process, operationalizing the one business, and onboarding our customer. So there will be a little bit more mention of. Truetraffic's process in this session just as a heads up. So if there are questions there, we can determine, at that point in time if we need to answer a particular process question in a different space or in this training, and we should also have time to continue our conversation around reporting and dashboards, and we're also going to finish off the reporting and dashboard conversation in tomorrow's session.

Danielle Velt
Alright. As always, this is gonna be demo heavy, so please feel free to follow along. Remember, we are in our production account for traffics, and we are going to be looking at our dashboards page to start off with as always. So let me share my screen. Alright. So this is where I had left off my home page for everyone if you were following along from the other day. So we did set our leadership dashboard as the default dashboard here. Again, we'll talk more about reporting and dashboards again towards the end of this session, but we are going to start with the pop process and pop deals. But just a reminder, your dashboard screen, if you're kind of mirroring what I'm doing here, your your dashboard screen should be your home page right now.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So the POP process, which stands for pre onboarding, onboarding, and post onboarding, is designed to ensure a consistent and high quality handoff from sales to ops after a customer is approved for credit and ready to begin shipping with traffics. So we remember from these last few sessions, right, that a deal is a type of object in Hubspot, and you can have individual deal records. Right? So each deal record is representative of a a particular, potential sale opportunity of a product or service. Right? It's where we're tracking actual revenue. So the POP process enables a repeatable onboarding process for us and a standardized path from credit approved to an active shipping customer. So it's that bridge between the sale closing, the deal closing, and account management and ops taking ownership.

Danielle Velt
Pop deals are automatically created in our pop pipeline. So if we come into Hubspot, we can actually see that. Remember, we can either go up to our bookmarks in the top left here and then click on sales workspace or the deal section, and remember, you can get to deals from the CRM section right here or if you click on the sales funnel icon from the sales workspace here. So if I click on sales workspace, I'm then gonna click on the deals tab here, and it might, default me to the sales pipeline. Remember, this is the pipeline we had been looking at for our past couple of sessions here. But on this right hand side towards the end of where we see these different view tabs up at the top, we wanna make sure that we're looking at the board view.

Danielle Velt
If you feel more comfortable to use the table view, please feel free to do so. But if we are looking at the board view, we also need to make sure that we are selected not on the sales pipeline, but on the pop pipeline really quickly so that we can see this. So it's a much more simplified pipeline in terms of the actual stages that we have here. So again, pop deals are automatically created for us in this pop pipeline. When a deal in the sales pipeline reaches that credit complete stage that we discussed in our previous session, and we need to note here that pop deals do not replace our sales pipeline deals. Instead, they're representing the onboarding life cycle after a sale is approved. So we're gonna talk a little bit about and break down each of our pop stages here. So we have pre onboarding. I have a couple of example deals sitting in this pre onboarding stage here. I'm actually going to open up one of these in particular.

Jeremy Schlachet
K. So I'm gonna click Sorry.

Ashley Marie Suski
That's a quick question.

Jeremy Schlachet
Can we follow along with you? But on our board, I don't have any that are in the pop phase. So should we put one in the pop phase so we could file along with you?

Danielle Velt
Oh, oh, Jeremy. I think it's because of permissions. Correct. Yeah. Because I I'm the owner of that pop deal. So, yes, why don't we just so that everybody can actually follow along here and to make it a little bit more simplified for us. So, yes, if you would like to follow along to the t in terms of creating a new pop deal, again, they will typically be automatically created based on your existing sales pipeline deal. But if you would like to be able to follow along by creating a new deal here, you can click on add deals, create new. Right? We've done this process before. We just wanna make sure we're selected on pop pipeline. So you could say this is our demo pop deal.

Danielle Velt
Make sure that you're selected on pre onboarding. You can enter any amount here. Make sure that we have a particular currency selected, the deal type. Again, typically, we we are not going to be creating pop deals manually, but for the sake of being able to see all of the information very easily right now, Just make sure we set a few properties here, all of the ones that are required with the asterisk. I'm gonna use my. I'm sorry. Company record.

Tony Pomocnik
Are we selecting a pop hotline as the pipeline drop down?

Danielle Velt
Yes.

Tony Pomocnik
Okay.

Danielle Velt
Correct. So we wanna choose pop pipeline.

Tony Pomocnik
Thank you.

Danielle Velt
And it should default you to the pre onboarding stage Just so that you're able to follow along if your permissions might be restricting you from seeing the pop deal that I'm looking at. Alright. It will ask you to associate a contacting company. I would recommend using the test records that you've been using in production up to this point, and I'm gonna do the same here, and then I can click create once I have all of the required fields filled out here. Alright. So, again, just for demo sake, we manually created a pop deal. But in reality, what is going to end up happening, the pop deal will automatically be created for you. So pre onboarding this pre onboarding stage that we're in right here, this is when operations is preparing for onboarding.

Danielle Velt
So an operations contact, operations escalation contact, and credit approved are being identified here. So once our deal in the sales pipeline reaches that credit complete stage that we talked about in one of our most recent sessions The associated company status should be prospect OCA generated, or our request for credit check field in Netsuite should be set to yes. So actually, if I go back, I'm actually gonna bring myself back to deals and continue on with my deals in the pop pipeline really quick here. I'm gonna go into this pop deal, and on the right hand side, I'm gonna bring us over to the company record.

Danielle Velt
So we can see we have a status of prospect OCA generated right here.

Danielle Velt
And if I click on actions and then view all properties, remember this is how we can see any fields that we're not immediately seeing on the left hand side here. I can also look for the request for credit check. So, again, this is related to Netsuite sync. So what you should be able to see later on is that this would be set to yes.

Danielle Velt
Alright, and if I go back to my deals here, I bring myself back to my specific pop deal. I wanna view all associated deals so it's a little easier to see them so I can go back to the right one here.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So I'm gonna choose my pop deal here. Okay. Awesome. So the other thing to note here so I've mentioned a couple times and again, just wanna continue to stress that your pop deal should automatically be created for you, and it will be associated to the deal in the sales pipeline that makes it to that credit complete stage. The other things that will automatically happen for you here is that this pop deal is going to be auto populated with the correct company association and contact associations that you had on the original sales pipeline deal. The deal owner should be the sales rep. So in this case, it's me. Right? So this is my pop deal, or excuse me.

Danielle Velt
Apologies. I believe I'm looking at the wrong record here. Let me come back. Yes. There we go. This is my pop deal. So. I am the deal owner of the pop deal, so that is being translated over from the original deal and from and also the close date should be set to 100 days from now, from the time that this deal is created. The deal type should be set to pop, and the pop stage should be credit requested, and again, I can, at any time, click on actions and then view all properties to find all that information. So if I need to find pop stage, I'm in credit requested already, deal type is pop, etcetera. So you can find all of that information there, and again, those things will be auto populated for you when we go through the typical process of moving our sales pipeline deal to credit request or excuse me, credit complete stage, and then we then have our pop deal auto generated.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So the goal in pre onboarding here is to achieve credit approved on the sales pipeline deal. So once credit is approved and Netsuite updates the Hubspot record to customer active, time based check in tasks should be assigned. So to the sales rep at 15, 45 and 75 day increments. So those are our check in time frames for our sales reps, and also check in tasks for the account manager, so at 30, 60, and 90 days. So it's a very.

Ashley Marie Suski
It's going yes. Sorry. Can we just pause for one moment? I wanna make sure because I've got lots of people in the chat. I'm not quite sure who can and cannot see things there right now, and I just want them if they're all following along too.

Danielle Velt
Yep. We can pause if we have a a question that's holding us up.

Tony Pomocnik
Guess I can ask mine. When we create the POP deal, you showed something needed to happen afterward. I think I was still creating a POP deal, I may have missed that. So it's not showing up on my board view or anything like that to follow on.

Danielle Velt
Tony, did you happen to add, set yourself as the deal owner for the POP deal? I did. Oh, and it and it's still not showing for you inside of the POP pipeline?

Tony Pomocnik
That's correct. I don't have anything beyond or before discovery, even populating. So.

Danielle Velt
Are you looking at the pop pipeline, though? Sorry. Just because you mentioned discovery and that's part of the sales pipeline, I just wanna triple check with you.

Tony Pomocnik
That may have been where I missed, when I was still creating it. So that's why I was asking. What was before what was after creating the.

Danielle Velt
Okay. Yes. So whether we're looking at the table view or the board view for deals, remember this is our deals homepage, we wanna make sure that we're specifically selected on POP pipeline and that you did create the deal in the POP pipeline.

Tony Pomocnik
Perfect. I have it now. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Okay. Perfect. No. I appreciate the call out just to make sure that I wasn't going too fast. So, yes, as long as it's been created in the pop pipeline and you've set yourself as the owner, you should have that pop deal to play around with, and it should have defaulted to the pre onboarding stage as long as we didn't change that default in the creation process for that deal. But you can also test out the full process if you still have a test deal from our previous session in the sales pipeline. So if I move over to the sales pipeline, my board view, and I move this deal, for example, over to Credit Complete, that should trigger the process.

Danielle Velt
It it may just take a couple of minutes for Hubspot to process for you and create that pop deal. But then you'll see each of those, elements that I mentioned should auto generate for you. Right? The the original contact and company associations from this sales pipeline deal should copy over to that pop deal, and you should see very specific fields set in particular ways. Right? It's gonna be labeled as a pop deal. The pop stage will be credit requested. It will land in the pre onboarding stage of the full pipeline, etcetera. Alright. Is there anything else big that we wanna cover before we continue on? Any other big blockers we're seeing at the moment?

Danielle Velt
Okay. Perfect. Alright. I'm gonna flip us back over to POP pipeline. Alright. So what we should see as we go through our pop deal. I'm gonna go back into.

Danielle Velt
This pop deal here. What you should see is these tasks that I mentioned. So at each stage of the pop process in this pipeline, we should see different tasks automatically be assigned to you. Right? So, again, we're trying to standardize this process, make it really easy for you as the sales rep or the account manager, etcetera, to understand what they need to be doing. So we have different check in tasks. We also have, during this stage, this pre onboarding stage, our goal is to identify and label our operations contact and our operations escalation contact, and one thing that's important to note here is that is actually an association between contacts and companies. So on the right hand side of my pop deal, I can come back over to my contacts and my companies.

Danielle Velt
I'm actually gonna click into the company record to go over to my company here, and on the right hand side of the company record, I'm gonna scroll down to my contacts here, and one thing we haven't yet talked about that I was saving for today because this is a perfect example is using association labels. So we've talked about how you can associate records to one another. Right? We can associate several contacts to a company record in Hubspot. We can associate several deals to a company record in Hubspot, etcetera. You can also label those associations, which makes it even easier to understand exactly what a particular contact is responsible for at a company. Right? A basic example here would be a decision maker.

Danielle Velt
Right? If you know that in the sales process, there's a particular contact on the team that you're working with at this organization and one person is the decision maker, you can label them as such versus someone who deals more with the billing side of things. So I can hover over a particular contact. So let's say my training demo contact, I need to be able to label this person as my operations contact. So I can click on this 3 dots icon all the way in the right of the full preview here of this particular contact, and I'm gonna see 3 options here, edit association labels, view all properties, and remove association. I wanna click on edit association labels.

Danielle Velt
So this is gonna bring a pop up to me, and I can choose an association label. So I need to click on this drop down, and this is where I can choose from any of the available association labels that are able to be put in place between a contact and a company. So in this case, I want operations contact. So I'm going to select that, and then I'm gonna click update. So now I can see this is a contact with the primary company and the operations contact, and maybe Anna is my operations escalation contact. So I'm gonna do the same process here. Click on my button, edit association labels, and I'm gonna set her as the operations escalation contact, and then I can click on update.

Danielle Velt
So, again, that is part of our process, as far as pre onboarding. If we're, again, going back to the POP pipeline itself, this is going to be one of your tasks is identifying, the operations contact and the operations escalation contact, and again, we do this most easily from the company record because we can see all of the different contacts that are associated, and we can then label them. I'm gonna pause here just in case we have any questions that we want to address.

Scott Sears
Is anyone mine only shows.

Danielle Velt
In the chat. It either says.

Scott Sears
Send survey, or if you exit out, it only shows single labels on mine, and then same with Curtis.

Danielle Velt
Scott, are you specifically looking at a company record and looking at the contacts associated? Because I think I know what you're talking about, and I think that might be looking at a couple of different objects and possible association labels between them.

Scott Sears
Contacts within a opportunity or deal, I should say?

Nicole Siemiawski
We.

Danielle Velt
Should be on the company company record looking at contacts.

Scott Sears
Okay. Standby.

Danielle Velt
No worries. I'm glad we asked. Yes. We wanna make sure we're looking at the con excuse me, the company record and looking at the contacts that are associated rather than being on the deal looking at the contacts. Alright.

Danielle Velt
Any other big questions to call out right now or anything coming through the chat that we wanna make sure we address before we continue?

Ashley Marie Suski
Well, we just asked if you could have multiple contacts with the same association label for the same company. Like, can I have multiple collaborations for the same company?

Danielle Velt
That is a great question. So if I attempt this with junior, right, so this is my third contact associated with this company. If I click on edit association labels, Hubspot will tell you if it's going to allow multiple of the same. So the way that this has been configured in Hubspot is it'll tell you as well. Right? There's this little pop out that says this label has reached its maximum number of uses. So right now, we can only associate or excuse me. We can only set one associated contact on the company as the operations contact and same with operations escalation contact. That's a great question.

Danielle Velt
Alright.

Jeremy Schlachet
Is there a way to manually start in the pop process without just manually start it? So let's say you wanted to pre board and all that, but you don't have a you're not ready to submit credit yet because you're just at the start point. Is there a way to manually put it into the pop process?

Danielle Velt
Jeremy, I wanna make sure I understand the question. Do you mean manually creating the pop deal like we did before, or Yes.

Jeremy Schlachet
Yeah. Yes.

Danielle Velt
Yes. So it should be possible if you come back to let's go back to our sales workspace. I'm doing some now.

Jeremy Schlachet
But I just think it has to do with there's no Netsuite number, which probably is. I would assume that's the problem, but let's see.

Danielle Velt
Oh, okay. Well, speaking from the Hubspot side, without connection to Netsuite, we can, from a technical standpoint, click on the add deals button and create new and go through and make sure that we choose to create a new deal in the pop pipeline.

Jeremy Schlachet
Okay. So you can manually push it through there.

Danielle Velt
If.

Jeremy Schlachet
Add companies. Where'd you I'm on the board. Where did you where did you click add deal? I see add companies.

Danielle Velt
Up in the top right, it should say add deals.

Jeremy Schlachet
Mine says add companies.

Danielle Velt
Oh, are you selected on the, the companies tab in the sales workspace?

Jeremy Schlachet
I am.

Danielle Velt
No worries. No worries.

Scott Sears
Yep. So we just wanna be selected.

Danielle Velt
On the deals tab inside of the sales workspace first, and then you should see add deals and then create new, and again, we just wanna make sure that we are selecting the pop pipeline if we are, for any reason, creating it manually, and if you are creating a pop deal manually, again, this is more from a technical standpoint rather than a traffic's process standpoint when I say this. But so when a pop deal is automatically created for you just based on, again, that sales pipeline deal moving to the credit complete stage, Hubspot is doing some things in the background autumn automatically for you. Right? It's going to associate the correct contacts and company and your original sales pipeline deal to the pop deal.

Danielle Velt
So you just wanna make sure that if you're, for some reason, planning on doing all of that manually, that you you do do that, when you go and create new. Right? So pop pipeline when we create the new deal, pre onboarding, and at the very bottom of this sidebar, I I wanna make sure I'm associating the correct original sales pipeline deal here, the correct contacts, and because it does not say on this creation form for this deal to associate companies after I create the deal, as we know, Hubspot brings us straight into that deal record. On the right hand side, we just wanna make sure that we're associating the correct company as well. Just to take care of all the things that Hubspot would normally be automatically doing for us if we were following the process of using that sales pipeline deal pushed to a specific stage to trigger the pop deal.

Jeremy Schlachet
Can I ask you a quick question? Sorry. I know this is annoying, but let me ask you. So can I share my screen really quick just to ask you this? It's it's relevant. So this one is in credit oh, because it's credit complete. But what but so how this wouldn't manually click the process of hop. Like, it's still in the sales pipeline, but it's in credit it credit's been completed. So wouldn't that start the pop process?

Ashley Marie Suski
So it creates a second. So, like, it's gonna be a totally different deal. It won't be the same deal. So then they're not can like, so then they're on two different pipelines. So, like, they're not measured in the like, those metrics don't impact the actual deal pipeline.

Jeremy Schlachet
So the POP pipeline is purely for that. Where would I see the POP process and the in the op okay. So there's the RFP. But where where would.

Danielle Velt
So if we scroll back up to deals so can we click on, excuse me, view all associated deals? I just wanna make sure. Yeah. It's that little button right there.

Ashley Marie Suski
Did you create one for this one, Jer?

Jeremy Schlachet
No. Scott put it through credit check, though, and so I thought that's what would start the pop process.

Danielle Velt
Okay. Yep. Adding it to the credit complete stage. So let me just double check here.

Jeremy Schlachet
Sorry. This is.

Ashley Marie Suski
No. But it might not. It doesn't have a net.

Danielle Velt
No. That's okay.

Ashley Marie Suski
It might be a UAT thing too that we haven't.

Jeremy Schlachet
Do I see that as a Netsuite number?

Tony Pomocnik
Is it because deal type is new business?

Ashley Marie Suski
No. It should so ideally yeah. Ideally, what happens is once you submit something for credit check, a pop deal pops up because that encompasses the pre boarding, onboarding, and post boarding. So it's going to automatically create in the pop pipeline pipeline. So it's not going to clog your deal pipeline. It'll be in a separate window. Yes. That that I do wanna I.

Danielle Velt
Think that's a great question that just came up and I wanna reemphasize because I think I mentioned it very, briefly when we started our session here. So because the pop process is separate from our sales pipeline. Right? The sales pipeline being Discovery all the way through Credit Complete and Close One. They are two separate pipelines with separate deals in them. Right? So when you get to the point of credit complete on your original sales pipeline deal, that then creates a completely separate deal for you in the pop pipeline. But there should always be that connection between the deals.

Jeremy Schlachet
So that's my question. Where would I see that? Because shouldn't that be here then with both? Jeremy and Danny, I'm checking on our automation, and it's actually based on the status. Status.

Anastasia Zhukova
Needs to be prospect OCA generated.

Jeremy Schlachet
So you you actually need to go through the whole you know, you send the the credit. Oh, okay.

Anastasia Zhukova
As as actually approved, and the status is updated, and then that's moves the deal into credit credit complete, and that's what.

Anastasia Zhukova
Creates the pop deal. So it's not just moving, you moving the deal into, Credit Complete stage. It is, based on, prospect OCA generated status of the company.

Jeremy Schlachet
But that's not a drop down that any user can use, though. So, like, in this case, it was completed as credit.

Ashley Marie Suski
So because he skipped the stage that was actually supposed to like, yeah. So when they do submit it for credit, yeah, it'll it'll populate it.

Jeremy Schlachet
Okay. Because I just haven't we've never I've never tested, that going to pop process yet, that's why I'm asking these questions. On the company profile.

Ashley Marie Suski
When they submit it so it's not even the deal has to go to that the company profile does. Okay. I know. All very new.

Danielle Velt
No. I appreciate the clarifying questions. Apologies. I yes. So I meant to say prospect OCA generated is what's going to trigger that for us. But again, I would say right now, we should if we need to play around with a pop deal and we want to see it in the pop pipeline, let's go ahead and manually create it in the pre onboarding stage here. Alright. Okay. We're gonna continue on and chat a little bit about onboarding. So when we are at the point of onboarding so onboarding and account management own this process and move the deal to this stage manually when ready. So for example, I'm gonna click on my deals, and remember, we're in the sales workspace.

Danielle Velt
We're clicked on the deals tab. I'm looking at my deals, and I am currently looking at the board view and specifically the pop pipeline. So when I am ready, I'm gonna work with this pop deal of mine. When I'm ready, I can manually drag and drop my pop deal from pre onboarding to onboarding. So this is the only stage that should be a manual move. Right? We talked about the fact that the pop deal itself is gonna be auto populated in the pre onboarding stage of the pipeline, and again, just quick correction there from earlier. This is based on our prospect OCA generated status on the company level, the company that is associated to your sales pipeline deal.

Danielle Velt
Alright. So when we are in the onboarding stage, this is when our welcome email and our custom contact sheet are sent. The external onboarding call occurs and the internal onboarding call occurs, and we also are assigning the primary and backup account managers. So, again, deals need to be manually moved into the onboarding stage of the pop pipeline, and we have those key tasks being completed. Our welcome email, our internal and external onboarding calls, primary and backup account managers assigned. So there should be tasks that are being automatically assigned to the correct users. Right? So our RDO and DOS alert that credit has been requested. Our sales rep is adding the operations contact and the operations escalation contact, and remember, again, that's an association label that we set between the contact and the company, and the sales rep and our RDO should see a task reminder for the internal onboarding call, and our sales rep and DOS should see a task for setting up the external onboarding call.

Danielle Velt
So you will again see all those different tasks assigned. If the task is being assigned to you, remember, you can see that up at the top right of your account if you click on the bell icon. So it's telling me right here I've been assigned to a few tasks, and if I click on that notification, it's gonna bring me over to my tasks section here, and again, our tasks section, right now, I'm looking at it, from the CRM view, meaning I'm clicked into my CRM booklet in the side navigation, and I'm clicked into tasks towards the bottom here. But I can also access the same tasks from inside of the sales workspace. So, again, if I come to my sales funnel icon in the nav and then click on sales workspace and then click on tasks, the tasks tab.

Danielle Velt
This is where I can see all of my different tasks. I'm actually gonna sort them over on the right here by their due date because I wanna see the most recent ones that have been assigned to me. In this case, I, just for example sake, have assigned myself as the sales rep and the account manager. So what you're seeing is, excuse me, different tasks based on everything that I just mentioned, and there are additional tasks in post onboarding that get assigned as well. So you're seeing a few of them right here. So send welcome email is one example, right, of what I just mentioned. So that's related to, my several contacts that are on that pop deal, and once our onboarding calls are logged, the account manager should be tasked to create SOP.

Danielle Velt
After the internal onboarding call, the RDO and DOO should be assigned the primary should be tasked to assign the primary and backup account manager. Right? So there's all these different tasks that will be assigned, and again, this is to make sure that we have that standardized process, and both our sales rep and account manager know what they should be doing and when. Right? So that task should appear in your task section here, and at that point, once we are getting closer to post onboarding, we're seeing tasks to add customer TMS details, add customer RFP strategy, etcetera. So you can see all of those things here. Right? I have a couple of different pop deals, so that's why I see a couple of these popping up at the same time.

Danielle Velt
So I can start all of my tasks or I could even filter for just a few of them at a time if I only wanna go through those at first. Alright, and I'm gonna bring myself back to the deals tab in the sales workspace. Because once all of that is completed, we're then moving to post onboarding. This is one more stage that should be automated. So just for example sake, I'm gonna go to my deals again. So I'm just looking at mine. Just for example sake, I am going to manually drag and drop from onboarding to post onboarding. But remember oh, I love that. I get confetti. So from pre onboarding to onboarding, that is the only manual stage, move that's required.

Danielle Velt
Because remember, pre onboarding, the pop deal is automatically, populated for us there, and then in order for the pop deal to move into post onboarding, that does not have to be a manual move. The post onboarding stage in the pop pipeline is reached automatically when the company's associated load count reaches 5 at least 5. So just to give a little bit of a a technical glimpse into how this works. So 3 g sends our load data through fabric, which is then sent to Hubspot, and then Hubspot associates the load records to the company. So when the number of associated loads on our company record is equal to or greater than 5, this will auto send our pop deal to this post onboarding stage. So it's important to remember that that the only manual stage move in the drag and drop is pre onboarding to onboarding.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I know there was a little bit more process discussion here, so please let me know if we have any questions here. I wanna pause, see if anything has come through the chat.

Nicole Siemiawski
I guess I can ask it because I'm asking the chat. You mentioned account managers being involved in preboarding, pre onboarding, and things like that. Totally makes sense. But then there's a point of the process with POP where RDOs and directors of ops have to assign the primary and backup. But wouldn't they already be assigned in the big like, you you get what I mean, Danielle? Like, you did talk about an account Normally.

Ashley Marie Suski
Yes. So the preboarding, there really isn't anything for account managers at that point yet, but it will alert, like, RDOs and things like that. So it just Danielle just isn't completely Okay. The log out of the process. Sorry.

Nicole Siemiawski
I I that's.

Danielle Velt
Oh, yes. Okay. No. Sorry about that. I I should have. You're fine. Also emphasized the ownership of each stage here. So for pre onboarding, the ownership of this stage is on ops and the onboarding team. For onboarding, it should be for the onboarding stage, it should actually be the onboarding team and account management. Right, and then at that point, when we're at post onboarding, ownership of that stage is on the account management team. So it starts with Sales still has.

Ashley Marie Suski
Like, there are things to accomplish. It still follows our pop process.

Nicole Siemiawski
Okay. Thank you. Just wanted yeah.

Danielle Velt
Appreciate everyone being understanding with me as well in terms of just making sure that we are aligned on the process piece as well. Okay. Wonderful. Before I switch gears, because we have about another 22 minutes here, and I wanna make sure we can do a little bit of a recap of reports and dashboards to set us up for tomorrow. I want to just make sure that we can address any other questions right now that are top of mind related to what we've just talked about with pop deals, anything on this topic before we switch gears?

Ashley Marie Suski
I can answer Hannah's question in the chat. Can you delete a deal? You have to request deletion for anything. We would want everything to be moved to, like, closed lost or closed won, and the reason why is if something was created by error, though, like, that's totally fine. You can request that to be deleted, but that's, like, an admin only function. I was mostly wondering for POP deals. Like, if it's a, like, does it really apply to POP? Like, if you're doing, like, a secondary bill to for a client that's already active, like, when you add credit to that second account, is it gonna create a POP pipeline and then you have that kind of bogging up your dashboard? Sure. So for.

Ashley Marie Suski
Go live sorry. That word was really not in my vocabulary for a minute. For go live, we will not have that as an option. But looking forward, I'm hoping that there's a way that we can opt out of the deal if it is something like that kind of situation.

Danielle Velt
Right. Anything else top of mind for pop process before we shift gears back over to reports and dashboards?

Danielle Velt
Alright, and Ashley, I'm sure you have, an internal for more of the process nitty gritty as well. Right? Okay. Perfect. Again, I appreciate everyone's patience with me just kind of giving a bit of an overview on some process pieces here for Pop. Alright. I'm going to bring us over to reports and dashboards here. So remember, to get back to dashboards, if if dashboards is still your home page, you can click on the Hubspot icon in the top left, and this brings us over to our dashboards page, or if it is not your home page, you can click very at the bottom here on the the left sidebar navigation into our, bar chart, which is the reporting section, and you can then click on dashboards to get to the same page.

Danielle Velt
So we talked a little bit in our last session about what exactly we're seeing in front of us here, and I wanna just quickly cover a little bit of what we covered in our last session, and then tomorrow, we're doing a bit more of a deep dive into reporting. Remember in the top left, we can select whatever dashboard we want to be looking at. So I just need to click on the name of the dashboard. It'll tell me, which dashboard is currently my default if I've set it, and you can also see Hubspot will automatically break down for you your recently viewed versus other dashboards. So anything else that I have access to see, as long as it's not a completely private dashboard, or it's not restricted from my view, I should be able to see it and select it to at least view it, if not, edit some reports, depending on my permissions.

Danielle Velt
So I'm going to stay selected on the leadership dashboard just because this is kind of a continuation of what we were seeing in our last session. Up at the top here, we can also add different quick filters. So Hubspot has the most common ones right here, are the date range that we want to see all the data for. If we only want to see data for certain owners, such as yourself, if you're looking for yourself, or specific teams. Right? So this is based on the team hierarchy that's set up in Hubspot. So if there is a group of users on one particular team, you can filter for that team here. Alright, and then all of these have been added as quick filters right here.

Danielle Velt
So it's very easy for me to say team is any of my team or I can select any different groupings of teams here. I can also select a specific date range. So these are all the same date range options that you should see throughout Hubspot if you're filtering on a date property, and then owners. Right? So this is what I mentioned before of I can just look at my own data here. So as soon as I hit apply on any of these filters, the dashboard should automatically reload just to show me my own information here, and I can x this out if I wanna clear that filter at any time. I also, in our last session, created a closed date quick filter here.

Danielle Velt
So remember, we can add additional quick filters by clicking on advanced filters in the center top of the screen, and I can either click here to add a regular advanced filter. Remember, it's it's just tucked away over here. So I could say, maybe I want to choose amount. So the amount the revenue amount on the deal, and I could say, just show me data on this dashboard where the revenue amount of the deal is greater than 1,000 dollars and click apply filter, for example, or I could add more quick filters because I want to see them up in the top bar here. So if I click on quick filters, I just have to click on add quick filter right here, and then I can choose what I want to filter on.

Danielle Velt
So maybe I want to filter on branch. So I can click on branch. This is just one of the first fields that I'm seeing as an example, and then I can click on customize. Best practice here is to set your label as the name of the field in Hubspot just so it doesn't confuse yourself or anybody else. So. I'm gonna label this as branch and then save, and now I can x out of this. Now I see branch up here, and now I can filter on this very easily. So let's say branch is any of, and then I could choose what I need to see and click apply. So if there is data to show, Hubspot will show that data inside of each of the reports on the dashboard.

Danielle Velt
Because any filters that I apply up here, whether they're quick filters or advanced filters, they are all being applied to all of the reports on the dashboard or they they should be 99% of the time. It should show you dashboard filters applied. Right? You can also have filters just on the report level, and we'll talk about that in a second. For now, I'm gonna clear all so I can clear both of these filters that I just set, and as a quick reminder, if I have permissions to create new dashboards, you will see the create dashboard button here. It's gonna bring you to an entirely new page where you could see different templates Hubspot has or create a new dashboard from scratch.

Danielle Velt
I'm gonna click exit for now, and I can click on the actions button, and again, depending on whether you have view or also edit permissions, you may be able to clone the dashboard and the reports on it. You can see dashboard details, view an activity log of the different edits that have been made to this dashboard. You can go into full screen mode to see all the data and cut out the rest of the noise on your screen. You can do a hard refresh on all of the data in the reports. Although Hubspot should automatically refresh each of the reports every couple of minutes, and you can set a dashboard as your default or remove it as your default at any time, and if you have, again, the edit permissions to do so, deleting a dashboard, and then you can also share the dashboard either by copying the URL or sending an email of the dashboard, and then if you have edit permissions, we can also add new reports, add images or text, external content from Power BI, for example, or go in to create a totally new report.

Danielle Velt
Alright. We're gonna talk a little bit more about the report level itself. So if I'm looking at a report on this dashboard, there's a couple of things I can do. I can move this report around. So in the top left, it'll say drag to move. So I can click and drag. It's kind of similar to moving a deal within a sales pipeline manually. I can also make it larger or smaller. So in the bottom right hand corner, you'll see a little triangle of dots here. I can drag that any way that I need to, it's very flexible.

Danielle Velt
And then I also have two buttons here. So there's one button that looks like it's kind of 3 lines with some dots on it. If I click on this, it's gonna bring up a pop up of just this one report for me. So this is where I can apply different filters, as I mentioned before, just to this one report. So this is different than applying filters to an entire dashboard. So I'm just looking at total revenue by sales rep. The report itself has been filtered for the create date of the deal being this quarter so far, and I can see what the other advanced filters are by clicking here. So I'm just looking at deals that are in a closed one stage.

Danielle Velt
Right? Because this report is showing me total revenue by sales rep. It it implies that we're looking at just deals that have been won, and then I can see my visualization. At any point in time, whether I'm in this pop up or if I'm just looking at the report on the dashboard not in this pop up, I can click directly on the data and see which records are being included in this data, which is really helpful. Right? If you're not sure why you're seeing a particular number, right, if you're if you're looking at this report for yourself, right, you can say, okay. I'm not sure why it's only showing, you know, $50,000 for me. For example, when I know that I've closed this amount of revenue in this quarter.

Danielle Velt
Right? So you can see what deals are actually being included here. It'll give you some basic information about them as well. So what's the deal name and the link to it if you do need to open it up, close date, deal stage, etcetera, and you can actually export the unsummarized data from this report if you need to through this button.

Danielle Velt
And at the very bottom, you will also see a summarized dataset or unsummarized dataset.

Danielle Velt
And on the right hand side, you can make quick edits to this report. So if I want to see a different chart type, for example, I won't save this. But just for example's sake, I'm looking at chart type, I can change it briefly right here or change it back, and you can choose how you want to group different information. So right now, the dimension I'm using is deal owner. Right? In this case, based on the fact that I'm using this particular chart type, I'm seeing deal owner on the y axis and then the deal amount, so that revenue amount on the x axis. So there's lots of different quick filters here. There's also an about section. So there is a description on most reports.

Danielle Velt
You may see some reports where a description has not been set. You do need to manually set this when you create a new report. You can choose to generate it with Hubspot AI, which can be helpful in some cases. Hubspot can look at the report you've just built and give you a quick description, and it will also tell you which dashboards if there are multiple that this report appears on. If you needed to go even deeper into editing this report, you can click on the customize button at the bottom here. That brings you all the way into the report editor. I'll do that just for a quick visual here. It brings us all the way into this report editor where I can then swap out anything I need to here.

Danielle Velt
Right? So I won't save this, but just for example sake, maybe I want to display deal owner and deal stage here. So that completely changes the visualization that I'm seeing here. Right? There's different edits that we can make to these reports. Alright. I'm gonna exit out of that and go back to my dashboard, and I didn't save it. One thing to note is that and I actually I think this is a perfect example. I think somebody made this report bigger on this dashboard. So it does affect the way that others will see it. It's a little bit different than the contact company deal home pages. Right? When you make customizations to weight to the way that that looks for you, that is individual to your user. If you are.

Jeremy Schlachet
That did that. I was the one that made it big like that. So you're saying that it was a mistake by me to do by doing that?

Danielle Velt
No. No. No. It's not a mistake. I it's just it's a perfect example. I'm glad you did that, Jeremy, because it's a perfect example to show that I didn't keep it pulled out like that. But since you did it and we both have access to view this one dashboard, it made it look this way for me as well. So it's a really good example, and I'm glad that you did that.

Jeremy Schlachet
Is that for any user, though? Like, could that be could any user do it or just people that have the rights to do that?

Danielle Velt
I believe it should be if you have edit permissions, you're able to do that. I don't believe that view permissions will let you even change the size of reports on the dashboard. So it's just something to be aware of that if you are sharing dashboards, as you likely will. You might have your own individual dashboard or like, a private dashboard that you wanna make for yourself. But if teams are sharing dashboards, especially with a leadership dashboard where we definitely have multiple people looking at it, we just want to make sure that we are not making changes that folks are not expecting. So just be aware of that. Dashboards are shared in that sense. So even changing the size of a report will show up for everybody.

Danielle Velt
So I think somebody wrote in the chat, it's not necessarily a mistake, I agree with that. It just depends on the edits that you are expecting. Right? If you are in a leadership meeting and somebody says, you know what? I I'll go and make a really quick update to this report that we're looking at and trying to analyze. Great, then that will update for everybody, and in that sense, we want it to be updated.

Danielle Velt
Alright. I'm just looking at the time here and wanna pause here in case we have any questions so far. There's a couple more things that I will cover on reports for us today.

Danielle Velt
Anything any big questions based on the reporting pieces we've recovered and now newly gone over?

Anastasia Zhukova
Then I think it'll be good to cover that if you have added and view permissions in general to dashboards and reports, it doesn't mean that you have access to all dashboards. When you create the dashboard, you can choose to share with some people with, you know, specific view access or specific added access. So if you look at this dashboard and you're not able to edit that, that's not an error. If you do need to do that, please flag it to Ashley. But otherwise, it's just how your permissions are configured right now.

Danielle Velt
Great call out.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Awesome. I'm gonna use a couple more minutes here just to go over a couple more things. So we just talked about this edit button. Right? So this is the icon on the left side in the top right of each of the reports. I can click on it. It's gonna bring me into this pop up that we just talked about, and I can x out of it. There's also 3, vertical dots here. This icon all the way to the right in this report, there's a lot of different things that you can do here to this one report. So because this report in particular is based on deals, I can actually click to go to deals from here.

Danielle Velt
It'll bring me to that deals homepage to be able to see the deals. I can hard refresh the data in just this one report versus the entire dashboard. I can choose to clone this one report, so it is creating a copy of that report. So perfect example, kind of going off of what we were just saying about the reports on these dashboards and the dashboards themselves being shared if multiple people are seeing them. If you wanted to just play around with a particular report, it may be best to clone that report if you need to play around with some things. If you want to explore, just have your own cloned report to play around with. You can rename the existing report here.

Danielle Velt
So I could rename it from total revenue by sales rep to something else. You can also export the data from right here. So we have the button in the pop up that says export unsummarized data and then this one as well. You can also share this one report via URL or email. We can choose to move this report. So if I click on move, it currently exists on the leadership dashboard, but maybe I want to remove it from the leadership dashboard and move it directly to the load dashboard, for example. So it takes the report from the existing dashboard and just moves it to the next one that I choose.

Danielle Velt
I can also choose to change the owner. So if I have permissions, right, this is not going to be with view permissions. If I have the permissions to change the report owner, I will see that option here. I can choose to add this report to another dashboard. So it's going to keep it on the leadership dashboard, but I can also add it to the load dashboard, which would then put this report on two dashboards, or I can just simply remove it from this dashboard. Right? We talked, the other day about how there are some reports that just exist in the reports library but do not exist on a dashboard, and that's completely okay. That is fine to have.

Danielle Velt
So if I were to remove this report from this dashboard, it's gonna tell me exactly what that's about to do. So it says this will only remove the report from this dashboard. The report will stay in your reports list and can be added back to a dashboard at any time. So different ways that we can move this report around if needed, and then if you have the permissions to do so and again, because reports are typically shared between users and teams, just be careful if you are in a position of deleting a particular report, but you can do so there. Alright. We have a couple minutes left, and I wanna keep that open in case we have any questions on anything that we covered today.

Danielle Velt
How are we feeling? How's the chat going?

Danielle Velt
I'll take silence as we are experts once again.

Ryan Lewin
I have a question or a comment maybe. Are are we working on which reports are gonna be, like, canned reports to specific reps or account managers that they're gonna just show up for them on day one and which, you know, that we're gonna create for them and kind of assign to them.

Ryan Lewin
Does that does that make sense? Sorry.

Ashley Marie Suski
Can you say the first part of the question again?

Ryan Lewin
I mean, like, I see a lot there's a lot of utility in these dashboards. Right? But we're relying on our on our team to pick and choose which dashboards they see doesn't seem to be the smart thing. Like, just pushing the right dashboards onto their I'm sorry. Pushing the right reports onto their dashboard.

Ashley Marie Suski
We meet about it tomorrow.

Ashley Marie Suski
I will add you to the meeting. So since you've had so I had originally put the people that had done the UAT testing with us, but I'm gonna add you to it. If you're available in the morning, I'll add you in here in to see what we want their standard dashboards to look like. So that and then I meet with, like, the account management leaders on. Friday, I think, to just make some basic dashboard pages for them so then like, they don't have to figure this all out from day one.

Ashley Marie Suski
So yes.

Ryan Lewin
Thanks, Ashley. You're welcome.

Danielle Velt
Awesome. Any other questions while we have a minute left here?

Danielle Velt
Alright. Awesome. I'll take, again, silence as we are feeling good. Remember, we have one more session tomorrow, and we're gonna be looking again at, dashboards quite a bit, but we're also going to remember I meant.

---
Ashley Marie Suski
Well, the one.

Ashley Marie Suski
Alright. Let's see.

Ashley Marie Suski
It looks like we have quite a few people.

Scott Sears
Danielle, did you go to Ithaca College?

Jeremy Schlachet
I did.

Scott Sears
I did also my first year.

Jeremy Schlachet
Oh, that's amazing. Small world. I lived in Lyon Hall my first year of college at Ithaca in Upstate New York. That's so funny. I was in, Rowland Hall, I believe.

Danielle Velt
Ithaca is gorgeous. Oh, yes. The puns.

Scott Sears
It's a good town, though. It was fun for the year I was there. It's too small for me. Too East Coast. I had to get back to my roots in the Midwest.

Jeremy Schlachet
That.

Danielle Velt
Is fair. I I've been in New England my whole life, so it didn't feel too different being in New York.

Ashley Marie Suski
No. Okay. It looks like we have pretty good group. We can go ahead and get started.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Thanks, Ashley. Well, congratulations, everybody. This is our final session. Can you believe we've been through 6 of these, and this is our seventh. So just a reminder, today is Hubspot for leadership. So what we are talking about today is reviewing individual and team me. Individual and team performance through all stages of the sales process, creating different pipeline views. We are going to start today with Dialpad calling. I know I mentioned last week that we would circle back to that piece, and we're so we're gonna reorient ourselves in terms of thinking about sales activities and demo that, and we are also going to talk a little bit more on the reports and dashboards piece, specifically looking at sales analytics tools, and then we're gonna do a really quick admin training, which is just gonna be kind of an overview of users, teams, permissions, and user adoption.

Danielle Velt
Alright. As always, I'm going to share my screen. Feel free to follow along in our production account if you would like to or follow along when you're watching the recording later. Alright. Here we go. I'm gonna share my screen. Alright. So we should be seeing Hubspot up in front of us, and remember, we're still on this dashboard's homepage. So if you click on the Hubspot icon in the top left corner, you're gonna be led to Yes. I'm so sorry.

Ashley Marie Suski
Danny. I know a lot of people got confused yesterday because it was a little tricky with permissions and things like that. Feel free to just sit and watch, Danny. You do not have to follow along with everything. You were gonna go through user training again with the processes involved, so, like, don't stress yourself out.

Scott Sears
Thank you for the call out. I will say.

Danielle Velt
Especially with our first topic, we are gonna talk about Dialpad calling. So if you're running into an issue right at this very moment with trying to follow along and getting Dialpad connected to Hubspot, please don't worry about that right now. I'm just gonna show what that is intended to look like once you do connect Dialpad to Hubspot as an individual user. So that's the first thing I want us to cover just because, again, that's kind of, a topic from last week that we had moved to today. So we are going to show what it looks like to actually make a call via Dialpad in Hubspot. The one thing I will say is likely before you attempt calling, you're going to need to log into Dialpad with your traffic's email address in a separate browser tab that first time just to make, again, that initial connection between Dialpad and Hubspot for your user, and once that connection has been made, you can refresh the page in Hubspot, and that's when we should be able to click on the phone icon.

Danielle Velt
We talked about this top navigation in our first couple of sessions. Remember, we talked about this phone icon. So it should ask you which provider you want to use once you've connected Dialpad through your Dialpad browser tab. So you'll see the options of Hubspot and Dialpad under this phone icon. So if I choose Dialpad, it's going to look like this, and I just need to open my calling window to enable Dialpad calling inside of Hubspot. So I'm gonna click on the button that says open calling window. So it's just going to ask me in the background to have this calling window up. So I don't need to have this right front and center. You can move it to a different screen if you use, like, a dual monitor setup or just have it behind your full Hubspot browser tab here.

Danielle Velt
So I just need to have this up. I can also use this, this calling pop out here, or I can choose to, again, keep it in the background. I can choose to make a call from right here, and notice how there's no longer an x next to the phone icon. There's a really small green dot here. So it's telling me that calling is enabled, and this is for my user. So I can choose to make a call from right here. I can choose to type in a phone number, but we're gonna talk about the more efficient way to do this, which is just going to the actual record where you want to make a call so that you don't have to manually type in the phone number.

Danielle Velt
So I could x out of that at any time. But just wanna show, and highlight the different capabilities from within this calling section inside of Hubspot for Dialpad. So you can actually manage your settings from in here just by clicking on this little down arrow on the top right. So that'll bring you over to your settings. You can even put on do not disturb, etcetera. It'll show you your phone number in there as well. You can see any recent phone calls you've made, and you can also have some favorites here, and then if you want to go to your live dashboard, that should pull up Dialpad in a separate browser tab for you. Alright. I'm gonna bring us over to my demo contact record that we've been using throughout all of our sessions.

Danielle Velt
So remember, I can either go to my bookmarks and go to contacts, or I can go to the CRM section and then go to contacts from there. I'm gonna click on the my contacts view just to make it a little easier to find this one, and I'm gonna go into the training demo contact. So from here, let's reorient ourselves. So remember, this is our contact record. This is where all of the information about our individual person that works at a particular company or organization, this is where all of the information about that person lives. So remember, we talked all about these different sales activities as we call them. Right? You can leave notes on this record. You can send one to one emails.

Danielle Velt
We had skipped calling at the time of talking about these sales activities, and that's what we're gonna talk about now. So, again, now that I have calling enabled, I have that Dialpad calling window up in the background, and now what I'm able to do is on this contact record, I can click on make a phone call, and then I can choose the specific phone number that I want to call. So that's gonna bring open Dialpad, and it's making the call out. Hi. If you record your name and reason for call.

Danielle Velt
Alright.

Danielle Velt
Let's see if we can get our tab up here.

Danielle Velt
Let me try this one more time for us. It's a little tricky when we're calling ourselves.

Danielle Velt
Okay. I'm gonna click call one more time.

Danielle Velt
There we go. So as soon as I actually pick up the call, since I'm still on this call, I've just muted myself here. I'm actively on this call right now, and I can see that by the fact that the hang up button, this red button in the bottom right of this pop out is still highlighted, so I haven't hung up just yet. I'm actually gonna mute myself though on both ends, and while I am in this call, I can set a subject for this call. So I can say this was my quick follow up with Danny. I can also select a deal to log this to, so let's say it is my LTL, and maybe I actually connected with the person.

Danielle Velt
So I need to set an outcome here. So was it a busy line? Did I actually connect with the person successfully, or did I need to leave a voice mail? Was there no answer, etcetera? Right? There's lots of different options here. I am going to click connected, and then I can enter call notes. So this is very similar to if you were calling through Hubspot. It really is asking for, majority of the same types of options here. It's asking for a call outcome and for you to leave notes. So I can leave my notes right there, and at the bottom here, you will also see that you can even share your screen if you would like to, you can record the call, mute or unmute yourself.

Danielle Velt
You can put the person on hold. You can transfer the call. You can add another person or another contact into this call, or you can go to your keypad here, and then when you're ready, you can choose to hang up that call. So you'll hear a little noise telling you that you hung up. You can still edit any of these notes right here before you click log call, and then when you're ready, you can click on log call, and it's really as simple as that. I'm gonna refresh my screen just so we can see how it looks when this call is logged, and remember, I can actually see it see the call itself in the activities tab in the center pane under the call section or also the activity section, and remember, I had previously pinned a note up at the top here, and I do have some upcoming tasks and upcoming sequence activity, which is why I don't see it at the top there.

Danielle Velt
So if you want it to be really, really easy to find, you can click on calls, or if I wanna find it on the activity tab here, I can just scroll down, and I can see the call that I just made, and I can click in if I need to edit any of these notes later on. Can also.

Jeremy Schlachet
Quick we got a quick question.

Danielle Velt
Yes.

Landinn Eckhardt
Whenever you record in the in the dial pad box, does it translate into that note section?

Danielle Velt
When you hit the record button? Huh. It should record so that you can see the call transcript.

Landinn Eckhardt
And you would just have to copy paste, but it doesn't go automatically into the notes section. Like so if you hit record, there will be another, like, transcription box underneath that.

Danielle Velt
Oh, I see what you're saying. I actually want to double check on that. If it's alright, we'll take that question offline, and we'll be able to circle back unless, Anna, if you happen to know off the top of your head. I do.

Anastasia Zhukova
That that recording, it might take a couple minutes to process, but it will be available. There would be, like, a play button right where. Danny has the call call connected. Under that outcome connected, there will be a little play button. You would be able to replay that recording and kind of access it from from Hubspot as well.

Landinn Eckhardt
Okay. But it doesn't automatically go into that notes section. You still have to transfer it over from the dial pad in in Hubspot. Correct?

Anastasia Zhukova
It will automatically log log on the call. So it it's it doesn't it's not gonna go in the notes section, but it's gonna log on this this call card.

Landinn Eckhardt
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. The only other call out I'm gonna make here, and I'll pause again for questions in just a second. So we can edit the notes at any time, and you can resave them here. I can also if I need to adjust the outcome later on, I can do that here. So these are all of our different call outcomes. I can also set the call type. Right? So if it's an attempt, introduction, discovery, or customer activity call type, and I can choose if it's an outbound or inbound call, and it will tell me what the call duration was. You can also add a comment if you would like to, a lot of times, you might be tagging a teammate just to let them know, hey.

Danielle Velt
Can you listen to this part of the call? Wanna get your thoughts on XYZ And I can hide those comments. But that is exactly how we can make a call specifically using Dialpad here, and just as with any of the other activities on this record, remember, we can pin an activity to the very top of this record. I can check out the history of when I edited different pieces of this activity. I can delete the activity or copy the link to it. Right? So it's similar to how we've talked about copying the link to a dashboard and being able to send that to someone and then open it back up in Hubspot really easily if you are another user. Alright. Do we have any questions on Dialpad calling from the Hubspot view here?

Ryan Lewin
Danielle, does that I think this is a question from one of the first couple sessions. But remind me, does this call also log in the company record?

Danielle Velt
Yes. So yep. That's a great call out. I wanna remind everyone of the associations piece here. Remember, all of these different activities are able to be associated with the company and with the deal. So we just wanna make sure if we for example, if we want to make sure that this is on the company and the contact, Hubspot should automatically look at the associations that this contact has to other record types and other records in general, and it should say, great. I'm just, by default, gonna put this on all the records for you. But maybe you know, I have a lot of different deals here. Maybe this doesn't relate to my pop deals, so I'm actually gonna uncheck those.

Danielle Velt
So now there's only a few different associations. This call is on several of my deal records that are associated to this contact, and it's also on the company record. So again, all of that should start to log by default to all of those associated records that are connected to one another, but you can uncheck that if you would like it to not appear on any.

Ryan Lewin
That's great. Thank you.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Of course. Scott, I see a hand up.

Scott Sears
So when I click that on the call button on the left side, it it brings up or my dial pad's open, but it doesn't actually call into anybody else. Did I do something wrong? Or.

Danielle Velt
Do you mean oh, go ahead, Jeremy.

Scott Sears
You gotta check I gotta check your settings in in Dialpad.

Jeremy Schlachet
Did the Dialpad's prompt show up?

Scott Sears
Yeah. It it shows the Dialpad screen. So here.

Ashley Marie Suski
We'll check integrations everything at another time. I wouldn't say it's necessarily you're doing something wrong, but I'm not sure if we have it all set up properly yet.

Landinn Eckhardt
Okay. Thanks.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Yeah. I will say at this very moment, don't worry too too much if you are running into a particular issue trying to follow along. We'll make sure that we can address those pieces after training. Alright. I'm gonna pivot us over to reviewing individual and team performance here. So we're gonna shift our minds a little bit. This was just again our follow up to make sure that we covered our dial pad calling inside of Hubspot, and now we are going to go back to the deal board. So remember, we can get there either from bookmarks, go into the sales workspace, or directly into deals, or if you don't have them bookmarked, CRM and then deals or sales and then sales workspace.

Danielle Velt
I'm gonna bring us into the sales workspace and then click on deals from right there. Alright. So we can review our individual and team performance through the deal board by looking at the metrics that are readily available to us here on the deal board itself. So we've talked a lot about this UI for the most part. Right? We are experts now in what this deal board looks like and what we're able to do and how we customize things here. But we wanna look at this a little bit more from the lens of actually analyzing some numbers, some performance after we actually filter. Right? If you want to see, the data for folks on a particular team or a specific team member, whether it's yourself or someone else.

Danielle Velt
So the first thing I actually want to call out is on the right hand side. So let's go all the way over to where we see the add deals button, this black button here, and right below it and to the left, It's kind of a small button here, but there is a button that says metrics. If I click on metrics, you're gonna see a whole new area pop up here. Sometimes it can be distracting, and I didn't want it to distract us in in our earlier sessions when we were going through just the overall UI. But now that we're talking about analyzing performance, you can, at any point in time, collapse or expand this metric section using that metrics button, and what it's going to show you are these KPI metrics up at the top here based on how you're filtered.

Danielle Velt
So remember, we've already learned how to filter all of this data in the deals area. Now it's a matter of looking at the actual performance based on those filters. So let's say I actually want to look at my deals. So I'm gonna click on the my deals saved view, which we've talked about before. It might, ask us to go back into the board view after I go to the saved view. So I'm gonna click on table view and go to board view, and then I'm gonna reopen metrics in this view. So now I'm seeing different metrics. Right? There's there's different metrics between all deals because there were about, I think, 70 there versus my deals is just 5.

Danielle Velt
Right? So if I wanted to look based on deal owner, whether it's myself or someone else, I can filter right here under the search bar for deal owner, and now I'm able to see a few things. I can see my total deal amount and the average per deal. So this is looking at the revenue, the actual amount on the deal. I can see the weighted deal amount. I think we've talked a little bit about this before. In Hubspot, each of our deal stages, right, so discovery, quote, solution design, etcetera, they all have a particular deal probability percentage, which you can see at the very bottom of the screen here, right, where we see weighted 10% under discovery.

Danielle Velt
So this weighted deal amount is looking at the full revenue amount with the deal probability in mind. Right? So that that number is ultimately going to look lower than the total deal amount, and you can see that average per deal there as well. There's also open deal amount. Remember, most of these stages are open, but a couple of them are considered closed stages. So discovery all the way through credit complete in the sales pipeline, these are all our different open stages, and then closed won and closed lost are the ultimate closed stages, and you can also see that indicated at the bottom here if you ever forget. If it's a 100% or 0% for the deal probability, that can indicate to you that it is closed, overall, whether it's won or lost.

Danielle Velt
So open deal amount is gonna be a little bit different than closed deal amount. So there's different numbers to take into consideration there. New deal amount, this is looking at the create date of the deal, and then the average deal age, so how long it's been open. So that can be really helpful, you can also click into each of these. Right? It's similar to the reporting that we looked at over the last couple of sessions. We saw that we can click on the visualization of the report itself and see the different deals in this case that are being taken into account in this reporting. Right? So I can check out my deal names and some basic information about these deals as well, understand what is actually going into calculating that number, and at the very bottom, again, I'm able to see the total amount per stage as well.

Danielle Velt
That's why the board view in particular is so powerful because I'm able to then see the weighted amount and the total amount in my as it says, company currency. Right? If that's US dollars, you'll see in in The US Dollar company currency, this is my total based on my filters, total revenue in the discovery stage right now. So right now, that kinda makes sense. Right? It's $0 because I have an amount of zero on this one deal that's in this discovery stage. But if I look all the way over at negotiation, I have a deal that has an amount of $10,000. So at the bottom here, I can see the total is 10,000, and because the deal probability for the negotiation stage is 50%, the weighted amount here is 5,000. Right? So pretty easy math. Alright. I'm gonna pause us here just in case we have any particular questions on how we can look at these metrics right away.

Danielle Velt
Feeling good. The probabilities are preset. I just saw that pop up in the chat. So the probabilities for each deal stage, they can be customized. So if for some reason, you know, the ops team, whoever's managing, the Hubspot this piece of Hubspot going forward at Trafix, they could change what the deal probability is for any of these stages. They could say, you know what? Discovery actually should be 15% in the future. So they are flexible. They are customizable. But every single deal, when it's in that particular stage, it's going to be the amount is going to be weighted the same way based on them all having that same deal probability. So we just can't have, you know, two deals in the same stage that have different deal probabilities. There's one deal probability to one stage.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Amazing, and one other thing that I want to call out. So we've talked a ton about how we can create different views. So let's say I actually want to filter not only by one particular deal owner here, but maybe if I come back to all deals, maybe I want to filter by team instead. Right? Because if I'm trying to do a larger view of an entire team and how they're doing, I can click on more. Remember, these are our quick filters, and I can actually choose team here. There's a couple of things to consider here. I if I want to see based on the team structure in Hubspot, I should choose Hubspot team here. So I'm gonna click on Hubspot team, and then what I'm going to see are all of our different it's it's our hierarchy structure of our team.

Danielle Velt
So we have all of our Canada teams here, and there's also Montreal broken out, Ontario broken out, Mexico teams, US teams, etcetera. So you can get really granular with which teams you actually want to see here. So just as one example, I'm gonna go back up to US. So I can choose to select all of these teams. So there are 16 US teams, and luckily, because of the hierarchy that we have set up in Hubspot for these teams, I only need to do one click if I wanna see all of them instead of clicking 16 times to add all of these teams here. But if I want to deselect some, maybe I don't need to include Chicago here.

Danielle Velt
For whatever reason, I wanna get really particular about what teams I'm looking at. Maybe I don't need ISC, and I really just wanna see a few teams here under US. Alright, and when I'm happy with that, that is my filter. So again, I'm able to look at this based on either a single deal owner or an entire Hubspot team to then look at these metrics from a little bit of a different lens here. So all of these metrics, the KPIs up at the top and per stage are going to change based on how a particular team is performing across this pipeline, and again, if I wanted to create this as well Augie Yes.

Scott Sears
There are only Augie, they would the DOS would only have access to their own functional group. Correct, and then the roll up would be. Ryan would have options for every group?

Ashley Marie Suski
Yes. But also so strategic solutions would be able to see all of the deals, like those experts. Okay. Rdos would.

Jeremy Schlachet
Be able to see So no one that option won't even be available for most people on this call?

Ashley Marie Suski
No. A lot of the people it will be available for because we got RDO Oh, that's true.

Jeremy Schlachet
Okay. That's true. Okay.

Danielle Velt
Great call out. Do we have any other questions on this filtering piece? I wanna make sure that if we have any big questions, we can.

Scott Sears
Can you save a filter and use that as your new filter going forward if you have, like if you wanna make that your new.

Danielle Velt
Like, bookmark it? Yes. So that's actually what I was going to mention next before we move on is, let's say, actually want this to be my view. Maybe I am managing these particular US teams just as a a random example here. So I'm currently filtered, and it's not saved as my own view. Right? I'm just filtered on this all deals view. So what I can do now is remember on the right hand side, if I make any filters anywhere, I can click on clone view. So it's gonna clone this all deals view with my current filter applied. So I'm gonna click on clone view. Remember, it's gonna give me a new tab here. I just need to rename it so I can say this is my US team's performance. Right, and then I can click the checkbox, and I've saved that. If you want to be clone one sorry.

Scott Sears
You clone once you've built it already, and then you clone it and rename it?

Danielle Velt
Yes. If you bombers, and if you are making edits to your existing filter, let's say or excuse me, to your existing saved view, let's say, for whatever reason I want to add, a closed date filter as well on top of the teams, maybe it's just closed date is this week, I can save the changes to this view. So if I navigate away before I hit save, it will likely not save. Right? Because I've navigated away from a change I just made to my view. So just be aware of that. But if I don't want that to be a part of my view anymore, again, I just wanna save that back, and then if I want this to be my default, it won't be so much a bookmark per se, but I can make my default, saved view the one it's the one all the way to the left.

Danielle Velt
So I just have to drag the one that I want to be there right when I open the screen all the way to the left, and that will always be there for you. So, again, this is unlike dashboards when we looked at that, yesterday, these saved views are personal to your users. So you moving around these tabs or x ing them out is not affecting anyone else's view. The only thing that would affect someone else's view here is if you were to delete either your view that's shared with others or if you somehow have permissions to delete somebody else's view that they've created.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Any other questions while we are looking at the deal board?

Danielle Velt
Alright. I'm gonna keep us going, and we're actually gonna talk a little bit about portfolio check ins. So this is shifting gears over to companies. So we're still in the sales workspace, but remember we have the deals tab, and then we also have the companies tab separately here. So if we're looking to look at portfolio rather than pipeline reviewing, we can look at, for example, the last contacted dates, again, for specific teams or for specific owners. So remember, if I'm looking at one particular company owner, I can use the company owner quick filter here and set that, or I can again click on the more button. I can again search for Hubspot team, add that here really quick, and let's say this time I do want all of Canada.

Danielle Velt
So all of my Canadian teams here are selected. I can now check that out, and remember, I can add another column because I'm not seeing oh, nope. I do have last activity date here. Perfect. But maybe I wanna cut out the rest of the noise around it. So remember, I can click on the edit columns button right here next to the search bar, and I'm gonna cut out some of this noise. I'm gonna remove industry, country, region, city. I really just want to have a better view of the last activity date here. So I'm gonna drag that up.

Danielle Velt
Oh, let me get rid of phone number. Nope. It does not wanna save for me. Okay. There we go. I'll hit apply, and now I can see my last activity date, and remember, I can use the sort button, which is right next to edit columns and filter. I can say I want to sort based on the last activity date, and I want to see the oldest. Right? Maybe I'm looking to have a conversation with somebody on the team. Maybe they've never had a last activity date with a company that they own, or maybe I just wanna see companies where there is a last activity date, but it's quite old. So I could add one more filter here and just say last activity date.

Danielle Velt
Actually, this is a perfect example of one caveat here. So last activity date is a quick filter here, but it's only going to allow me in the quick filter section to choose a specific date. It's not going to just let me be able to say that it's known. So I can go into my advanced filters here. This is me actually just noticing this on the fly. So if I click on advanced filters and then add a filter, I'm gonna choose last activity date, and now I should be able to make this declaration of is known. So it's just a little more, again, advanced, in the sense that the quick filter would let me choose the date, but I just want anything that is known.

Danielle Velt
So maybe it was quite a while ago. Right? It was the November because I'm still choosing to sort by last activity date is the oldest for this group of company owners and teams. Right? So it's helpful to look at the data from this lens, and also, there are some premade company saved views that may be helpful to folks on this call as well. So remember, I can check out the different company views that exist here by clicking on the plus button next to these all companies and my companies tabs. So I'm gonna click on the plus button and then click on add view. When I do that, I'm gonna see Hubspot provided. Admin promoted is still kind of Hubspot provided.

Danielle Velt
I can see anything that I've created, so any saved views that I have created myself, and then ones that are public that are created by others. So I can choose to load more and look at all these different ones. So I have a few here. I have director of operations as one that I can choose to add here. So it's looking to filter based on director of ops is me, and then we have some similar ones here. Right? I can even search for them up here. So I want sales manager, and then I can add that, and I'm just gonna add a couple more of these. We have director of sales as well.

Danielle Velt
And we have also have operations manager.

Danielle Velt
Okay. So these are just quickly filtering to make sure that it's looking at, okay. I am the operations manager. I'm the director of sales. I am the sales manager, or I am the director of operations. So making it a little easier for you to filter that way as well. So whether you're looking based on the overall company owner and wanting to check out their portfolio, or if you're looking for entire teams, or if you want to see the company records where you are the DOO or the sales manager, the DOS, or the operations manager, etcetera. You can see all of those things from these views here.

Danielle Velt
Any questions on what we just covered with companies? If if not, we are going to switch gears and talk a little bit more about reporting and dashboards.

Danielle Velt
Alright. Awesome. Okay. We're gonna go back over to dashboards. I am going to go back to the Hubspot icon in the top left because, again, that is the dashboard is still my home page. If you've already made your home page the sales workspace, remember at the very bottom of your navigation on the left hand side, you can click on the bar graph icon here, and this is our reporting section, and you can click on dashboards, and it should lead you here. Remember, you can click on the name of the dashboard if you're not already seeing the leadership dashboard, and you can make it your default dashboard all the way over on the right here under actions. It'll say remove or set as default depending on if it's already set for you.

Danielle Velt
So. I can filter this dashboard by a group of teams as well so that I'm seeing specific data in these reports and also filter for a specific date range. So I can choose those teams right here. Right? This is a very similar, if not the same sort of UI that we've already been seeing across our different objects. So I can say teams under this quick filter is any of and again, it's gonna show me my same exact team structure here. So it will never it should never look different for you. I can choose all of my Mexico teams. Maybe for whatever reason, I just want to exclude one of them. Right? It's very easy to do that, and then I can click apply, and remember, all of the data on the dashboard is going to automatically change, and and it's based on the filter you just applied.

Danielle Velt
So it'll tell you dashboard filters are applied, and here are the following filters that you've applied at the dashboard level that are affecting this report, and I can also choose a date range here. So remember, this is another one of our quick filters, and I can say either the date range is or is after, is before, is between. There's a lot of different options here. But for the sake of this example, I'm gonna choose is this quarter and then click apply. So if there is data to show, it will load here for us. But that is going to be the best way to be able to analyze this data on that deeper level. Right? You can also, if needed, add those same filters that we just saw on the company level.

Danielle Velt
So if I wanted to add quick filters or just go into the advanced filters and remember, you can actually choose director of sales just as an example. In this case, it's on the deal level, though, so just remember that. It will tell you what category the property or the field falls under because of the different data that appears in these reports. Right? These reports are based on deals. So if there is, in this example, a director of sales field on the deal level, I can say I want to see data for all the deals where I am the director of sales on this dashboard.

Danielle Velt
Right. So it really is as easy as that to get those filters applied and be able to analyze that data. Before I pivot us over to what's called the sales analytics tool, I wanted to save that for today, especially because we covered a lot of ground the last couple days with how to look at the data inside of a report that's already been put on the dashboard, the filtering, and the actions up here and for the different reports. Do we have any questions here before we look at sales analytics?

Danielle Velt
Alright. Perfect. So we're still staying on the reporting front. But what we are going to be looking at is specifically what's called the sales analytics reports provided by Hubspot because they are very insightful and they can be very, very helpful. So there's a couple of ways to get to sales analytics. It's something we haven't looked at before. But, again, it's going to feel very similar to some of the reporting we've already been looking at. So on the left sidebar, we can go to the sales section, our little funnel icon. At the very bottom, I can click on sales analytics right here, or I can also go to reporting and then reports. So either way, it'll bring you over to where we're about to look.

Danielle Velt
Under the reporting section, there is another section here on the left that says analytics suites. So I can click on sales, and I can see 3 different categories of sales reports. So these are Hubspot prepared reports that can be really, really helpful when you're looking to analyze further any of your data for yourself or for your teams. So for example, under activities and leads, if I wanted to just see call outcomes, for example, I could do that. Right? We just looked at how you actually log a call through Dialpad into Hubspot. So those will log as actual call activities and be able to show up in a report like this. Right? So it's showing me just as a an example here, this month's data in terms of call outcomes that were logged, and if I hover over any of this data, it's going to show me what exactly I'm looking at.

Danielle Velt
So it says no value, and you can actually see that up in the top of the legend here. That means that and I'm not surprised that right now, we don't have any call outcomes assigned to these different calls that have been made. Right? All of the call outcomes right now are blank. But as we start to set different outcomes, you will see for example, for each of these users, there will be different values and different, numbers of calls with specific outcomes.

Danielle Velt
I can also choose to see the data over time. I would have to set a time range to see that. But it's very easy to play around with what you're seeing here, and and this analytics suite view is unique to you. So if you're playing around with some of the filters from right here, right, if you wanna say last activity or excuse me, the activity date is last quarter instead of last month, that's only going to edit it for you until you get to the point of saving this report to a dashboard. So let's say you do end up creating a dashboard that's private for yourself because you want to pull some of these reports on and play around with them.

Danielle Velt
I could pull this report into my own dashboard. So once I'm satisfied with whatever filters I want to set here, up in the top right where it says actions, I should be able to save this to a dashboard, but I'm not seeing that. That's interesting. Oh, it's because it's my favorite port button. I should have led with this at the start of our training, everybody. I am using my traffic's email address right now, and it has slightly different permissions. I had to do that for our Dialpad calling demo. So apologies. You should be seeing the ability to save this report via the save button. It is grayed out for me just because I'm using my traffic's email right now.

Danielle Velt
So you should be able to save the report from the save report button. It will ask you then what dashboard you want to put that report on. So if you own your own private dashboard, again, you can really easily add it there, and then there are all different types of reports here as well. So if I wanted to see overall completed activities, I can see all of that here. So how many calls were made, how many tasks were left per person. Right? So on the y axis, I'm seeing who that activity was assigned to, so the actual owner of the activity, and then the count of activities on the x axis, and I can also change the visualization here.

Danielle Velt
So right now, I'm looking at this as a horizontal bar. I could choose different visualizations as I see fit though. It depends on what you're trying to analyze, what's gonna be the best way to do so, and you'll always see what we've seen before. Right? The summarized and unsummarized datasets, you can click into any of this to see what data is actually being accounted for here.

Danielle Velt
So there's lots of different options here. If we're logging a lot of meetings as well, you can see the meeting outcomes, total tasks completed, and remember, the filters that we were just looking at on the dashboard level can still be applied here on these report levels, and they're already premade reports for you, so I would recommend definitely leveraging these as we start to really use the system and have our clean data loaded in. But, again, it's as easy as filtering for specific Hubspot teams or who the activity is assigned to, this is on the activity level, this is essentially the owner. This is kind of the equivalent of the owner here, and I can see things like the team activity timeline as well. So it's just letting me know here's a log of the things that have been happening day to day, and then we have our deal section. So these are completely based on deals. So if we wanna see average deal size across different owners, deals created.

Danielle Velt
Our deal funnel. So this is looking at deals actually going through that full sales pipeline and through those different stages. It may take a minute to load. Yes. Because this is looking at it's what's called, like, a a stanky, report visualization. Right? So takes a little bit, longer to load sometimes, but really helpful to be able to see, okay. What is the drop off from discovery to quote to solution design, etcetera, and how how do we end up at close one, or what is our our cumulative, conversion and conversion between steps. So, again, lots of different reports here. I would recommend taking a closer look at what will be most helpful to you in analyzing either your own performance or the teams that you are managing or that you need to be looking at, and over on the right hand side under the about section for each of these reports in this analytics suite, it will tell you what exactly it's calculating. So I I like to give this example with the deal pipeline waterfall because it's a little confusing at first glance. It will tell you what it's actually showing you.

Danielle Velt
And then the last section here is forecast and revenue. So if we're trying to forecast out what will likely close, we can do this with a couple of these different reports. So I can first see deal revenue by source. So this is Hubspot trying to categorize where did these deals come from exactly. Forecast category. So this is looking at, if we are trying to forecast not based on just one pipeline, but across different pipelines. So for example, if we were looking at all the deals in the sales pipeline plus all of the deals in the pop pipeline for whatever reason, because there are different stages in those two pipelines. Right? The pop pipeline is much shorter. There's different stages.

Danielle Velt
If we wanted to put them all into one forecast for for whatever reason, we could do that with this forecast category report. So we'd be essentially handpicking and saying, okay. Well, there's two or 3 stages from the sales pipeline and maybe only one stage from the pop pipeline that I would categorize as this pipeline category versus the best case category versus commit, etcetera. These are just the Hubspot defaults, but this can be customized further based on your own needs, and forecast category is only based on if you're trying to forecast across multiple of your pipelines. But for something like, just one pipeline, if we're just looking at the sales pipeline, for example, we can use the weighted pipeline forecast and choose the exact pipeline we want to be looking at. So I just wanna see the sales pipeline. Fantastic. I will be able to see based on the deal owner, my total revenue goal, and if we're achieving that in the date range that I've set.

Danielle Velt
And if we've set any particular goals. Right? If we have revenue goals that are being tracked in Hubspot, you can see the quota attainment here as well. How close am I to my revenue goal for this month or this quarter or this year?

Danielle Velt
Alright. I'm gonna pause here in case we have any questions on how we can navigate through the sales analytics suite. Again, I know there's not too much data here right now, or at least not accurate data just yet because we have yet to load the accurate data into production. But do we have any big questions here?

Danielle Velt
Alright. Amazing. Okay, and I'm just taking a quick look at the time here. So we're just gonna take a couple of minutes here, and we are going to do kind of an overview admin training. So, again, I mentioned at the start of this training that we would be talking a little bit about users and teams, permissions. We're gonna just take a quick glance at how we look at workflow errors, where we find those if we needed to see that at any point in time, and our user adoption dashboard and where that is. So we're actually going to shift gears and up in the top right corner of Hubspot, we're gonna click on the settings gear icon. Remember that's between the question mark and the bell icon.

Danielle Velt
So remember this brings us over to our general profile and preferences, and on the left hand side, I'm going to click on users and teams, and again, what you're seeing me go through right now, you may or may not be able to do everything. It is going to depend on your own permissions. So just be aware of that. If you have any questions about that, please just drop them down.

Scott Sears
You got to the screen by clicking settings and then where?

Danielle Velt
Settings, and then on the left hand side here under oops. There we go. Under account and account management, we wanna click on users and teams. Okay. Alright. Perfect. So if we have the permissions to be able to see users and teams here in Hubspot, you should be seeing a screen like this. So I'm seeing a user's tab, and that's where I'm gonna be defaulted to here. So up at the top, it's going to give me some quick KPIs about our users in this account. So who are the recent users that have logged in? Is anybody inactive for any reason, and it'll ask you if you want to review those users. We can see if anybody's been deactivated.

Danielle Velt
So maybe if somebody leaves the traffics team, we wanna deactivate their account just so that, you know, we're we're not dealing with any security issues, or inaccurate user data. We can see how many, users are pending invites. So whether they have set up their Hubspot account yet, maybe their invitation email has been sent out to them, or maybe it hasn't just yet. If any of those invites have bounced for whatever reason, on the admin side, you can choose to manage that in a different way and send them an invite a different way if needed, and then if we have two factor authentication enabled, you can see users that are enrolled in two FA. Hubspot is going to default us to looking at only the users with invite pending, bounced, or accepted.

Danielle Velt
So it's not going to show us deactivated users by default, but you could check that on if you wanted to see that as well, and I will see all of the email addresses and or the names of the users inside of Hubspot, and I'll be able to see a quick glance at if they have a permission set assigned, their overall access, who their manager is, their main team, if they're on any extra teams for some reason, because you can have a main team and you can also add that person to additional teams in Hubspot. You can see their invite status. Are they a partner? Probably not. My user is a partner in Hubspot, so that's really what partner means.

Danielle Velt
It's just indicating, is this somebody who is on the traffics team or your Hubspot partner, and then the created date, when was this person actually added to Hubspot? Same as with contacts, companies, deals, everything we've looked at before, you can edit these columns. So if you're not seeing certain information that you want to see about a particular user, I can click on edit columns, is right under this create user button, and you are going to see different user information here that you can add to your view. Again, this is going to be personal to your own view. So you can choose maybe I do want to actually see their branch, for example, because we have that as a user property and I want to drag that up and then apply that, and now I can see if there's a branch assigned.

Danielle Velt
So it's really just a quick user table for you to be able to see what's going on with each of those users. I can edit their permissions if I have permissions to do so. Remember, you may not be seeing exactly what I'm seeing here, but you can potentially go into edit the permissions for a particular user, and it's going to show you all the different possibilities for permissions in Hubspot. So it breaks down all of the the different sections. Right? In marketing hub, in sales hub, in service hub, in the reporting section, what do we need folks to have access to or this particular user to have access to, so there's a lot of things to expand and collapse here to see what do we need to actually manage here.

Danielle Velt
And then I'm gonna very briefly touch on this. We have seats in Hubspot, which folks on this call may or may not know about already. So we have what's called sales enterprise seats. We have core seats. There's all different types of seats here. The most important ones for this crew, I believe, are going to be the core seats and the sales seats. So sales seats give us a little bit of additional capabilities in the sales hub area, but you can rest assured that you should have the right seat based on the permissions that you need between core and sales enterprise. But this is just a quick breakdown of all of that. On the admin side, there may be a need to add more seats or remove somebody from a seat or swap a seat, etcetera, and then we have our team section.

Danielle Velt
So this is what we were seeing when we were filtering for Hubspot teams on the company's page, on the deals page, and on that dashboard that we were looking at. Right? So, for example, we have our corporate section. If I click into corporate. I'm actually gonna go back because I did that very quickly. But if I'm looking at corporate right here that I just checked the box next to, I can click in here and I can see there are different nested teams. Right? So you can see how far these nested teams go in. It looks like corporate just has quite a few teams right within it. There are no additional nested teams. Right? It says zero next to the nested teams for these teams right here, and you can also see the number of team members here.

Danielle Velt
So just as an example, if I click on cloud operations or I'm hovered over it and I want to click edit to see who is on this team or add someone else to this team, I can see all the different users in Hubspot and add somebody else to this team, or change the team name at any point in time or change where this team is nested. So if if this cloud operations team doesn't need to be under corporate any longer and it actually needs to be underneath a completely different team. I can find that team here.

Danielle Velt
Alright, and then we also have our permission set section here. So this is going to be all of the different permission sets that can be applied to different users. So what you'll notice, for example, we have operations manager, and you can see all the way on the right hand side, this is how many current users are assigned to that permission set. So it's really trying to standardize, especially at the enterprise level, how somebody's permissions get assigned. Right? Because a lot of times, we might have 50 plus users that need to be in the same exact permission set with the same permissions based on their day to day activities. So that's how you can manage that. You can click on the permission set itself and click on users to add users to that permission set.

Danielle Velt
Alright. That was a quick overview for us of our users and teams, and I wanna do a very quick overview for us of, automation errors and just where we can find them. Because, again, if we're talking about, from the admin level, we just wanna be aware of this. So on the left sidebar, we're gonna click on the automation section. It's right above the reporting section here, and then click on workflows. Remember, workflows is the Hubspot terminology for automation. So it's actually very, simple. What you're going to be able to do here is up in the top right, it's going to say review automation issues. So if I need to look at any automation issue that might be happening because we might have a lot of different workflows here as you can see based on this list.

Danielle Velt
But I'm just gonna click on review automation issues, and I'll be able to see what is the actual issue, when was the last occurrence, and how does Hubspot rate it. Is it a high, medium, low priority, and what is going on with it? Right? So with this particular error, the send internal email notification, I can click on that, and it's going to tell me that maybe this one error happened in a couple of different workflows, and so I just need to click into these to see which records might have been affected. Right? So we're just clicking in to see what exactly is going on. Maybe I need to go into this particular record, view it in the CRM to see what happened there, and at any point in time, if you if you know that you fixed this or we just want to ignore it, you can mark as fixed or ignore or defer this error and say, I'm actually gonna go back to this later. Alright, and the last thing I wanna call out here on the admin side is if I come back to my reporting section and dashboards at the bottom of our nav here.

Danielle Velt
We also have a user adoption dashboard here. So if you ever need to view that, I can click where it says leadership dashboard up at the top here. I'm gonna type in user adoption and select that, and you're going to see a few different reports here. So this should hopefully help, with analyzing a little bit more data beyond just what you see in that users and team section. So the last login date for different users, and remember, you can click on this data to see which users, invite statuses overall, users by their seat type, email status by user, calendar status. So remember, these go back to has a user not connected their email address to Hubspot yet or not connected their calendar. Is there no recent activity for a particular user, and there's also an audit log in Hubspot that we can see. So what different changes are we making across the system?

Danielle Velt
Alright. I know we're just about out of time here. So that is everything I wanted to make sure we cover, and I wanna give us a quick minute here if we have any last questions that we need to cover.

Danielle Velt
How are we feeling? We made it through everything.

Ashley Marie Suski
Thank you so much, Danny, and I know this last part doesn't always apply to everyone, but hopefully, you learn more about Power BI and just the other technology that we're running and starting with here, this helps just kinda give you, like, the backend view so you can kinda piece how it all goes together. I feel like understanding some different technologies, like, really help you kind of comprehend something that you're working on. Like, if you're really close with Power BI, can be like, oh, I see, like, this is probably like it is in Hubspot in this way. So, hopefully, that just helps your brain start understanding permissions and users and all the things that go into it. So next time you're emailing with service desk, you know it's not always just a bloop fix. It can be a little more complex than that even though Hubspot makes this so easy.

Ashley Marie Suski
Any questions or anything?

Ashley Marie Suski
Thank you so much, Anna and Danny. Appreciate you. Of course. Congratulations.

Danielle Velt
Everybody. You made it through 7 sessions. That is no easy feat, and thank you for listening to me talk for 7 plus hours over the last couple weeks. I think everybody has been so engaged, and I really hope that.
