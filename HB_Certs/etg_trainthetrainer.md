Danielle Velt
Good morning. Morning.

Matt Scaramastra
How are you?

Danielle Velt
Good. How are you?

Matt Scaramastra
Pretty good.

Matt Scaramastra
It's almost making me sign in again, and it's also making me sign to Zoom, which is weird because I'm clearly logged in to Zoom. Oh, I see it's scanning itself permissions again.

Matt Scaramastra
I might have to drop out and rejoin.

Danielle Velt
Okay.

Matt Scaramastra
Let's see.

Matt Scaramastra
Well, the sidebar's up. Doesn't appear to be recording anything. Let's just drop and come back. Oh, wait. No. It looks like I am recording.

Matt Scaramastra
Alright. I guess that's good enough.

Danielle Velt
Alright.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. I can't believe we're doing ETG training. I can't believe it's actually here.

Danielle Velt
Yep. We are here. Yeah. I I just made a few additional test records that I can use along the way today. But, yeah, today's gonna be just a lot of terminology and looking at records and customizing views and things. So get everybody warmed up.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. It's always, like, mental, like, gymnastics maneuver for me to, like, go from my default Hubspot. I don't know.

Danielle Velt
Go all the way back to the Perspective to.

Matt Scaramastra
Like yeah. Like, okay. Like, reset here. Not everybody has the.

Matt Scaramastra
Experience to draw on, but.

Danielle Velt
It's That's what Anna said too. She was like, I don't she she was like, I don't know if I like to, like, bend my brain that way to, like, go all the way back to basics. Yeah. My past experience, my brain was just, like, wired to always do that.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah, and I was gonna say it's probably a matter of practice. Like, if you're if that's if that's something you do a lot, it's easier to make that interpretation.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Definitely.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah, and I'm not expecting, like, a lot of questions on today's call, and I thought Daria's follow up was definitely great that there's not a lot of of the elearning, not a lot of responsibility around building out the elearning. So.

Matt Scaramastra
I think after these two trainings are done, our responsibility around here is pretty much.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. For training is.

Matt Scaramastra
Pretty much wrapped up. Yep. It's wild.

Danielle Velt
Fantastic.

Matt Scaramastra
I'm always paranoid that Evoma's not gonna be recording after getting burned by it, like, twice. I'm like, record button's showing. The cloud is showing. The live transcript's not popping up. What does that mean?

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. It says transcript's recording.

Matt Scaramastra
Is the VOMA showing for you?

Danielle Velt
I don't think so. Actually, isn't it normally the aptitude 8 notetaker? That's usually what I thought was.

Danielle Velt
Letting me know it's it's also kind of transcribing and recording to Avoma, but maybe I'm wrong there.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. Sometimes it'll show itself as an as an attendee in the room as a notetaker.

Danielle Velt
Yep. That's normally what I would see, but I'm not seeing that right now.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. Do you have in the top right, like, the little Avoma recording thingy?

Danielle Velt
Well, it says recording in Zoom, but then is this. I don't see anything in particular.

Matt Scaramastra
Let's let's both drop out and then just rejoin.

Danielle Velt
Okay.

Matt Scaramastra
Alright.

Danielle Velt
Hello?

Matt Scaramastra
Howdy.

Danielle Velt
Good morning. Good morning. Happy Friday.

Matt Scaramastra
I know.

Danielle Velt
This is the best. It's Tuesday, but it's Friday.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. Yes, and the weekend is 8 days long, 9 days long.

Danielle Velt
Yeah, and then oddly enough, we're coming back on a Friday. So it's it's gonna feel very weird and then immediately the weekend again.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. That's actually gonna be a good a good way to come back, I think. A one day work week just to just to, like.

Danielle Velt
Just, like, clean out the inbox and like, just focus on catching up mostly.

Matt Scaramastra
Get some get some essentials done, make some make some essential communication, and then back to the weekend.

Danielle Velt
Yep.

Matt Scaramastra
My son went skiing today.

Danielle Velt
Oh, that's fun.

Matt Scaramastra
Mountain finally opened. Yeah. Nice. It's like the latest opening in decades. But, anyway, yeah, yesterday's training, I thought went great.

Matt Scaramastra
I mean.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. Especially with only two sessions, I was like, okay. We gotta. I'm kind of comparing it to, like, Trafix in my mind. Like because they had 7 sessions, so I'm like, okay. We we gotta go a certain depth into each of these things in order to cover it all in two hours.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. For sure. For sure, and I don't know about traffic's, like, internal, you know, enablement team, but. ETG does. I mean, they're gonna synthesize what we provide and spin it up into, like, their own internal that's what the elearning will be.

Danielle Velt
Yeah. I think Trafix also has an l and d team, but I think the way they I think they just wanted to approach it a little bit differently probably because like, they wanted more in depth training because they felt that their users were gonna have a really hard time with learning a new system. Like, they knew sub zero about Hubspot, and I think may not be as, like, technically oriented in general. So I think that's why they opted for, like. I was, like, repeating things from the previous day into the next day and things like that, like, to make sure that it really lands.

Danielle Velt
So, yeah, today, we will not have time to to completely cover, like, terminology and things again, but. I think we'll have the right amount of time for what's left.

Matt Scaramastra
Got a few people in the waiting room.

Danielle Velt
Alright.

Danielle Velt
I can get my screen up again.

Matt Scaramastra
Cool.

Danielle Velt
Alright.

Matt Scaramastra
Right.

Matt Scaramastra
Showtime.

Danielle Velt
Good.

Matt Scaramastra
Morning, everybody.

Matt Scaramastra
There's a number of folks still joining, so we'll get started in a few minutes.

Serkan
Hello.

Susana Hernandez
Hi.

Matt Scaramastra
Hello.

Phumi Mazibuko
Hello?

Matt Scaramastra
Good morning.

Balazs Vegh
Hello?

Felipe Dias
Good morning, everybody.

Balazs Vegh
Before the presentation or training, will you please tell us when will we have the the authorization to use the test version, the sandbox? One question. Another question is that, will we have the recording, soon?

Matt Scaramastra
Sure. Yeah. Both great questions. I know the recording will be sent out by Daria, so you'll you'll receive that through some internal communications. As far as provisioning to the sandbox environment, that also is a question for your team internally. But I can raise that with Daria, make sure that you get a response quickly.

Balazs Vegh
Thank you.

Daria Klassen
Team, good morning. Good afternoon.

Matt Scaramastra
Good morning.

Irina Corcodel
Good afternoon.

Daria Klassen
So today, we have 53 people confirmed. So I guess we can just wait for a couple of minutes. Anyway, we'll have the recording so the people will have everything later.

Matt Scaramastra
Sounds good.

Sergiu
I wanna take a moment then to first to say hello to everybody and to highlight that the Roundtrip logo is not the correct one. That Roundtrip is.

Sergiu
A different company from from The US, so nothing to do with ours.

Matt Scaramastra
I appreciate you calling that out, and I and you'll have to forgive us for that oversight. No problem. I'm gonna see if I can update that while we're on the fly here.

Daria Klassen
Guys, shall we start? Just, like, 5 minutes already.

Matt Scaramastra
Yeah. Sounds great. Let's go. Well, thanks everybody for, joining session two today. Won't take too much time for introductions since, we covered that yesterday. So I'll just hand things off to Danny to, take us through, part two of our training.

Danielle Velt
Awesome. Thanks, Matt. Good to see everybody again. Alright. So as we know, this is part two of Hubspot train the trainer. So just as a quick, introduction slide again for our agenda. So we are going to be going through life cycle stages in Hubspot, lead scoring, lead routing, deal pipelines or sales pipelines, and then reporting and dashboards. So same as yesterday, we have a lot to cover. So I am going to get us out of presentation mode here and bring us over to Hubspot. So please remember, we are using a testing environment, which is indicated up at the top here where it says standard sandbox, and you should have access to either the sandbox or production in the near future if you do not already.

Danielle Velt
As Matt covered before, definitely make sure that you are coordinating with Daria and the internal team to make sure that you know when you will have access to those different environments for Hubspot. But for today, same as yesterday, we are going to be demoing throughout the sandbox or testing environment. So the first thing that I want to cover with this group today is life cycle stages. So we covered this yesterday as part of our new Hubspot terminology that we were learning. Right? We talked about life cycle stages and the fact that what we are doing with life cycle stages is we're essentially categorizing contacts and companies or business partners as being in a specific stage of their buyer's journey.

Danielle Velt
So for individual people, those contacts, or business partners, you can essentially determine where are they in that first time buyer's journey. So if they're already a customer, if they're already, you know, essentially signed with you and working, that is where the life cycle journey ends for those first time folks. Right? When we have not yet done business with an individual or an organization, business partner, that's when we are focused on, looking at their life cycle stage on the whole and tracking that progress. So if we remember from yesterday, in our sidebar navigation towards the very top, we have our CRM booklet here. This is where we can see all of both of our standard objects and our custom objects that we talked about yesterday.

Danielle Velt
So remember, if I come over to contacts, these are my individuals in the system. I'm gonna pull up my example training demo contact from yesterday just so we can take a closer look at life cycle stages here. So if I come on to any contact record in Hubspot, I'm going to be able to scroll down and see life cycle stage values, and we have life cycle stages set up and configured per brand. So we have them separated out and segmented for API, CTM, and retail all separately. Right? Because we could be in different points of that buyer journey for each of these different segments. So you will always be able to see these right here. If you are not seeing them in your view for any reason, you can always click on actions up at the top here and either view all properties.

Danielle Velt
Right? That brings up our sidebar here, and you can dynamically search for life cycle stage. Oh, let me pull that up. Life cycle stage, and then if I scroll down, I should be able to find my life cycle stage properties right here, or if you want to add them to your own view, you can click on actions and then customize properties. That will bring up a similar sidebar here, but I can essentially add properties to my own view. So this will not affect anybody else's view. This is just affecting yours. So I can say, I want to see life cycle stage. If they are already added, you will see that there are checkboxes here, and you'll see them at the very bottom here.

Danielle Velt
We can also see this on on the company level, and again, if you're not seeing them, you can add them. But remember, if I come over, I'm gonna look at the associated company to this contact. So now I'm on my company record, and if I scroll down, I've added the life cycle stage properties at the company level for myself as well just to, again, keep them really close to the surface here for me on this record, and what you are going to see as well, if I come back to this CRM section, I'm actually gonna go back to contacts just to demo this. There is a life cycle stages view. I believe we saw this very briefly yesterday.

Danielle Velt
But, essentially, if I look at this all contacts tab up at the top here, I can either view my contacts as a list, which we did yesterday, and we did the same with companies, or I can view contacts or companies on the board. So if I click on the board view, this is going to show, Hubspot's default life cycle stage. So just be aware there is a difference between Hubspot's default life cycle stages that exist here and the custom life cycle stages that we've set up for ETG that are per brand. So. I'm likely going to want to stick to viewing my contacts as a list and focus more on reports in Hubspot, traditional reports, which we will look at a little bit later today, to be able to look at life cycle stage progression because, again, they are hyper customized for ETG based on API retail and CTM. So we either want to be inside of the contact or company record to look at those different life cycle stages or be looking at them through traditional reporting.

Danielle Velt
I do also want to call out what these specific life cycle stages are. So if I click on this drop down, I'll be able to see the different values here. So, for example, with a lead, just to give everybody a high level overview of how we are currently defining these life cycle stages and the automatic moves that Hubspot will do for you as our contacts, complete different actions. So we're gonna talk about lead scoring in a few minutes here. But, essentially, if a contact has a lead score between 10 and 69 that would automatically push them to becoming a lead in Hubspot for the right brand. Right? We are doing lead scoring also on, an API CTM and retail segmented level.

Danielle Velt
So for lead, we want a lead score between 10 and 69 and there are different criteria for each brand that go into, actually developing that score. For MQL, if they are above 70, if they are 70 plus in terms of their lead score, Hubspot will automatically push them to marketing qualified lead. SQL is a bit unique here, so I wanna make sure that everybody is especially aware of anything that requires a manual push. So for SQL, we wanna make sure that we're going into this record, this contact. Let's say that I am the sales manager qualifying this contact. I wanna make sure that I'm going to view all properties, and I need to check off sales manager verified.

Danielle Velt
We have a field here on the contact level, so I need to check off sales manager verified as yes. That is what will, ensure that this contact is pushed to the correct life cycle stage to specifically SQL here, and then we have opportunity. Again, you may be familiar with this phrase of opportunity because it is common in other CRM systems. But in Hubspot, we technically call the deal itself a deal, and we call the life cycle stage an opportunity. But, essentially, if this contact has an associated open deal, so in one of those open stages, which you can see on the right hand side here. Right? I do actually have a deal here that is in opportunity identify, and we will talk about deal pipelines very shortly here.

Danielle Velt
That is what will, allow this contact to be pushed to this opportunity life cycle stage. They have an open deal associated with them, and then we have signed and working. So these are based on and dictated by the associated company or associated business partner status. So remember, I have an associated company over on the right here. If that status is set to signed or working, that will ensure that the contact is reflected as signed or working respectively on the contact level here in the correct life cycle stage property, and then we have two more down here. So if somebody falls into the category of nonbooker or fraud so nonbooker is looking at their GBB segment. It's either nonbooker or dropbooker, and then fraud is actually manually set.

Danielle Velt
So in Hubspot, there is no automation at this very moment in time to move a contact to fraud. We just need to, manually identify that, or that would be a value that would be syncing from a different system into Hubspot. Alright. So that is everything I wanted to make sure we cover on the life cycle stage front. I'm gonna bring us actually over to lead scoring. So one thing I would like to call out is that on the contact level so remember, we're looking at this individual contact here in Hubspot. On the right hand side, if I scroll all the way down, I'm going to see a lead score section. So I mentioned this a minute ago.

Danielle Velt
We also are doing lead scoring on our brand level here. So we have Ratehawk API, Ratehawk retail, and round trip CTM, and we're looking at what's called both fit and engagement when we come up with a lead score. So with lead scoring, this is what allows Hubspot to identify different attributes or fit criteria about this person that makes them a really good fit for specifically. API versus retail versus CTM, and same with engagement. So is this contact engaging with particular pages on the website? Are they engaging with specific marketing emails? What are they engaging with on the marketing and sales front, and how should that influence updating their lead score and either increasing it or decreasing it.

Danielle Velt
So with this example contact, of course, I don't have, very high lead scores at the moment because this is a demo contact for us. But you will always be able to see on the right hand side here, the lead score per brand is going to update based on the actions taken by this contact. So, again, that's based on engagement and then the attributes or the fit. So the different field values on this contact or its associated company or business partner. So I'm able to see these scores. They will automatically update every single day, multiple times a day if certain actions happen. Right? If I update a field value and that field value is part of, the lead score, meaning I set a certain field value a certain way and there were supposed to be 10 points attributed to that value, then great.

Danielle Velt
Hubspot is gonna recognize that and update the lead score automatically for you. So you can always see the lead scores right here. If we need to ever update lead scores, though, we wanna come over to our marketing hub icon, which is right underneath the CRM icon on the left sidebar navigation, and towards the very bottom, you're going to see lead scoring. So I can click on lead scoring right here, and you're going to see those exact same 3 lead scores that you just saw on the contact level right here. So this is where they were built sort of, in in the lead scoring tool itself, and then that translates over to the contact record. So if I ever need to come in and edit, I can hover over the specific, lead score that I want to edit, and I can click on the edit button.

Danielle Velt
That brings us into this scoring model that we've created. So we wanna make sure that we are looking at the correct criteria that's been set and adjusting it accordingly. So for any grouping of criteria, you will see that there's a name for it. You can change that name if you need to, you can also change the group limit. So for example, there's a lot criteria right in front of us here for Ratehawk API that is based on segmentation type. If I have maybe multiple values for segmentation type and all of these points add up together, right, it's 8 plus 10 plus 14, etcetera, I'm capped at 60 points being applied to this contact's lead score based on all of those numbers being added up and then meeting all of that criteria within this one group.

Danielle Velt
So think of the group limit as truly a limit on how many points a contact can get from that one grouping of criteria. So for Redhawk API, we're going to see a lot of criteria here based on segmentation type. You can always change what the property is that we're filtering on here if you need to, this looks very similar to the way that you would filter for regular field values on the contact and company level like we previewed yesterday. Right? So you can choose the property here. You choose the designation. So what are you actually or how are you actually filtering? Is it supposed to be, the value is any of, is none of, is just generally known, is null or unknown, etcetera, and then you can choose to add or subtract points on the right hand side here.

Danielle Velt
So based on whether it's a negative attribute and you want to make sure that points are subtracted versus adding to their lead score if it is a positive attribute, and if you need to clone this grouping or delete it, there are those options all the way to the right over here, and then you can change whatever the value is as well. So you'll notice there's a lot of segmentation type criteria. There's also a number of employees. So, again, these all are part of the fit portion of this combined score because we're looking at both fit and engagement. We have annual turnover values as well. So, again, very easy to come in and update this if you need to delete or clone or just edit the values themselves. Right? Annual turnover being a number property. Do I need to change the values here?

Danielle Velt
And then we also have those engagement pieces that were mentioned before. So has the contact opened a marketing email, clicked on a link in that marketing email, or replied to a marketing email, etcetera?

Danielle Velt
So lots of different criteria, and again, you'll notice there's all these different groupings. There are group limits. You can also choose to remove the group limit or delete this entire grouping of criteria or clone the entire thing. So, again, very easy to come in and update the criteria at any point in time if you need to, I'm gonna exit us out of there. Alright, and I want to pivot us over to discussing our automated routing rules as well. So between Ratehawk and Roundtrip, we have slightly different lead routing logic. So when a new lead comes into Hubspot and we are at the point of needing to route them to a particular sales manager, for example right. Let's say let's think of this as the journey of my particular contact here that we've been looking at.

Danielle Velt
Let's say that I actually do have a lead score that is above 70 on my demo contact here, this contact, as soon as we get to the point of needing to route this contact, essentially, what is going to be looked at let's say this is a rate hawk contact. Hubspot is going to be looking at the region ID and the contract type to determine who specifically to route this lead to, so remember, if I'm not seeing the property or the field right in front of me on the left hand side here, I can choose view all properties, and I can look to see what is the region ID or is there a region ID on actually, it will be on their associated company.

Danielle Velt
Let me bring us over here. So I can look at based on my associated company here, what is the region ID? Is there one currently? Right? So whether we're entering that inside of Hubspot or it's syncing from another system, we will have a region ID designated, and we also know that the brand is rate hawk here. So Hubspot is looking at that combination to be able to route correctly. So setting our sales manager correctly here, and then similarly with round trip, we're also looking at the geographic region ID and based on our brand being set on our business partner here, being set as round trip. If we ever need to add or remove a user from the logic here so maybe we have a new team member that's come on, and we need to add them into that routing logic to allow them to be assigned, a specific business partner, what we would do is we actually want to come all the way over to our content section in Hubspot.

Danielle Velt
So this is on the left sidebar navigation right underneath marketing, and about halfway down, we wanna click where it says Hubdb. So this is the tool that allows us to actually set up kind of the more advanced logic here that we have for round trip and rate hawk lead routing. So, for example, if I click on rate hawk lead routing, it's gonna bring me right in here, and what I'm going to see is the user's email. So who is the actual sales manager here, for example? It's going to show me the region ID and the contract kind, the user type. So there's a lot of different details to be able to plug in here, and if I need to add a new user, I can click on add row, and that's where I would then enter that new rep's information here.

Danielle Velt
So very, very easy to be able to add somebody's information, or let's say that this particular user is actually leaving the team, I can remove this row to make sure that they are not included in that routing logic any longer. So it is a very easy table to update depending on if there are any team changes over time here.

Danielle Velt
Alright. We're gonna shift over to talking about our sales pipelines or our deal pipelines. So we're gonna shift gears over to, sales Hub. So I can actually do one of two things here. I can either view the deals from the CRM section. Right? If we come to CRM and then deals, or if you'd like to look at this through the sales workspace, if you come over to Sales Hub in the sidebar navigation and then click on sales workspace, you'll also see there is a deals tab there, and it will bring you to a similar view to this. So in Hubspot, I know I mentioned this very briefly yesterday, and we got a very brief preview of this, but we have 3 different sales pipelines here.

Danielle Velt
I would typically recommend looking at the board view for deals. So right now, we're looking at viewing our deals as a list up in the top left here, but I can also view deals on the board. So if I do that, it's going to show me the entire sales pipeline right here in front of me. I'm actually going to hide these metrics really quickly just so that it's a little easier to see the board. But just know that up in the top right, you can either show or hide basic metrics up at the top of that sales pipeline, and right next to where I switch to the deals on the board up in the top left here, this is where I can select the specific pipeline that I want to be looking at.

Danielle Velt
Notice that it will show you that you cannot view all pipelines in the board view. The reason for this is because, typically, we will have different deal stages in each of the pipelines, and the board view is only meant to show you one of those pipelines at a time for that reason. Right? Because they're all different deal stages, and each of these columns correlates to a deal stage. So just as an example here, I'm gonna click on the retail pipeline, and I just wanna talk us through how this pipeline can be navigated. So we have some sample deals in different stages here. We have welcome outreach to negotiation to contract created to first booking placed to first booking paid activated to close won to close lost, and then we also have an on hold stage.

Danielle Velt
So this sales pipeline is meant to be navigated left to right. So each of our deals that fall into the retail pipeline will start in Welcome Outreach and go from there. One big call out here is that the Welcome Outreach negotiation and on hold stages automatically influence the deal's associated company status, so the business partner status, updating to first interaction, negotiation, and on hold respectively. So when we are in welcome outreach, our company status will be first interaction. When we're in the negotiation stage on the deal, the business partner's status will be negotiation and then on hold as well. So when the deal stage is on hold, our company status will be on hold, and then when it comes to our company status or our business partner status of signed and working and disabled, those company statuses are going to automatically influence the deal stage.

Danielle Velt
So there's a bit of going back and forth in this particular pipeline in Hubspot on which deal stages or which statuses update and influence the other record. So remember, this is why the association between the deal and the company is very important. That's what allows Hubspot to say, great. I am going to now use the deal stage to update the company status and then vice versa when it's necessary. So when we're in the signed working and disabled stages, we are navigating through contract created, first booking placed, first booking paid activated to close won or close lost.

Danielle Velt
And one big thing to note here as well is that deals this particular pipeline, in the retail pipeline, cannot skip stages when moving forward. So a really nice thing about this board view, not only that you can see all of your deals in the specific stages that they're currently in, is that you can also drag and drop to the next stage. If there are any required fields to fill out going from one deal stage to the next, Hubspot will prompt you to fill those out, and we will see that in a second here. But I can essentially just start dragging and dropping my deal as I need to to update the stage if needed.

Danielle Velt
So all the way through the pipeline, very, very easy to do so, and remember, this is essentially the same UI that we saw yesterday with contacts and companies. Right? We are able to with the addition that we can filter for the pipeline, but everything else is the same here. I can search the name or description of a deal to locate it. I can use my quick filters up at the top and add additional ones. I can add advanced filters. I can add views or create new views and be able to clone that view to create a new view of my own.

Danielle Velt
Alright, and then we also have the API pipeline. So important things to note here, deals in this pipeline can actually skip stages, and you can move backwards if needed. So for example, if I move from opportunity identified in the API pipeline to commercial validation as my next stage here, and maybe I need to move backwards for some reason, I should have the ability to drag and drop backwards. There are going to be required properties to fill out and recommended properties to fill out as we go to different stages here. So let's say I'm bringing my deal all the way to, API test keys requested this particular stage. This is what I mentioned a second ago. If Hubspot knows that you need to fill out specific fields when you drag and drop your deal to the next stage, it's going to prompt you with this sidebar to fill those out.

Danielle Velt
So this is the deal stage I'm trying to move my deal to, right now, it's just recommended to fill out commercial terms, technical discovery, and initial contract sent. So just to kind of say yes, and check the boxes on each of these. Maybe I'm not sure at this point or I haven't yet done some of this. So for right now, because these are recommended, I can just hit apply. But it's going to keep reminding me and prompting me as I get closer and closer to the point where I really need to have done these things to set these to yes, and if I've already done it so let's say I've already done it for commercial terms, I'm gonna click apply.

Danielle Velt
When I move my deal to the next stage in the API pipeline, it's going to bring this up again, but it's going to show me, hey. You've already filled out this field, so I don't need to do it again. This is a great example of a required property that's coming into play. When I get to the point of our API integration implementation in progress stage of this pipeline, it is going to ask me to enter a date a date to complete our implementation that's in progress. So there's going to be a calendar here where I can select what that date should be, and there is an asterisk here. That means it is required and not just recommended.

Danielle Velt
So I can click apply, and now my deal has saved in that stage. If I don't fill out a required field, Hubspot's not going to let me move the deal to that stage. So we just wanna be aware of that. So I can keep moving my deal. Again, it's going to come up with these just as recommended so I can check them off as I go. I'm gonna keep dragging and dropping. Maybe I don't have any more information just yet, so I'll click apply. Keep bringing my deal to the next stage, and again, this is one more big call out. When we get to the point of API certification in progress, this is where we have one more date to enter.

Danielle Velt
Right? Because the cert is in progress, so when is that anticipated completion date? So I can enter my date and click apply, and then when we get to the point of contracts finalized, let's get us there. So there's one more stage here with the recommended fields. Once we get to contracts finalized, this is where it becomes, entirely required that we have done these things. Right? We have, checked off the boxes for commercial terms, technical discovery, and our initial contract sent. So I just need to make sure that I have all of these ticked off to yes, and then I click apply, and then I'm sitting in my contracts finalized stage. So, again, just some callouts there on recommended versus required stages.

Danielle Velt
One thing that I also wanna call out here with the API pipeline is when we get to or if we get to, let's say we get to close lost. So maybe I didn't actually end up winning this particular deal. I'm gonna move it over to close lost. It is going to require me to enter a closed lost reason. So maybe in my case, it's on hold, and because I chose on hold, there is actually a follow up date that I need to select. So this is a completely dependent property based on being on hold as my close loss reason here. So maybe I need to follow up in a few weeks, and then I can click apply, and now my deal is set in close lost.

Danielle Velt
Alright, and last but not least, we are going to talk about the CTM pipeline. So we have a few less stages here in the CTM pipeline. We have going from sales assessment all the way to the left here to op identified to proposal, negotiation, closed won, then onboarding, trading, and closed lost. So the CTM pipeline is a pipeline that has some strict stage progression, so I can't skip any mandatory stages. So, for example, if I wanted to go all the way to negotiation, Hubspot should not allow me to do that directly from sales assessment. Assessment. It should make me go through the necessary required stages here, and if I move from sales assessment to op identified, we're gonna see a very similar sidebar that we just saw in the previous pipeline. Right? So if I want to successfully move my deal to the op identified stage, I need to fill out anything that is required here. Right? So initial discovery meeting, was it held or not held? So I need to fill out all of this information.

Danielle Velt
And it should be quite easy because most of these fields are going to be drop downs. Very easy to.

Danielle Velt
Select each of these things. I'm just gonna enter some text here in the open text fields, and one thing you will notice as well, as you go through the CTM pipeline, it is going to be required to have an associated contact with their first name, last name, job title, department, email, and phone number all filled out. So Hubspot should show you if you've done that already. So please note these fields at the bottom that look at the associated contact should be read only for you, and it's going to the deal is going to look at the associated contact and prepopulate these values for you. So it's just ensuring that we're not moving forward in the process before we have an associated contact with all of the required contact information filled out. So just for example's sake, because I have super admin permissions here, let's fill these out. But on your end, you should be seeing that they would be read only, and we're gonna fill out a phone number.

Danielle Velt
Let's do a different one here. Okay. Oh.

Danielle Velt
Okay. Wonderful, and then click apply. So now it will allow me to move that deal into that stage. There might be some stages such as proposal that are not requiring any fields to be filled out. So, again, Hubspot will always prompt you to ensure that you know when you have to fill out any particular details, and when a deal moves to onboarding so let's say we are at the point of onboarding, I am just going to, for example's sake, move us over to onboarding.

Danielle Velt
I'm going to overwrite that rule for myself, to be able to skip some stages here just to show this. But when we get to the point of closed one onboarding and trading, so this is where on the sales manager side, we will be restricted from editing the deal any longer. So we're essentially passing the baton to the account management team. So when we're in Closeone, onboarding and trading, this is where the account management team has access to edit from that point on, and if we are in Closelost, this is where only super admins, so those with the highest elevated access in Hubspot, would be able to edit any deals that land in closed lost. So just be aware of those permissions between the sales manager side and the account manager side for these stages.

Danielle Velt
Alright. We are going to pivot over to reporting. So in our left sidebar navigation, all the way at the very bottom, so right below the automation section and above the Breeze section, you should see a little bar chart icon, and it will say reporting. I'm gonna click on dashboards under the reporting section. This should lead you to your dashboard section and potentially a default dashboard. It's okay. If it leads you to a specific dashboard and you haven't set it as your default. You can set one as your default, and we'll talk about how to do that in a second. But this is where you will be able to access any dashboards that are shared with everyone in this account, or if you have any private dashboards, you can see your own here, or any dashboards that have been shared with you and your team.

Danielle Velt
So. I can also access regular reports from here. I do wanna show just a quick glimpse of this if I'm in my reporting section. This is where I can see reports that live in this Hubspot account regardless of whether they are currently on a dashboard or not. So just be aware, there is a difference between seeing reports on a dashboard. A dashboard is just a collection of reports in Hubspot versus a report can exist, it can just not live on a dashboard. So if I need to see a report that is not on a dashboard, let's actually pretend that this top report here is not on any dashboard even though it says one here. I can still click into this even if it's not on a dashboard and see the data in this report, and I can choose to add this report to a dashboard if I would like to, so I can click on actions and click add to dashboard at any point in time.

Danielle Velt
So there's a lot of options here if you need to do anything to a report, a singular report on its own, and you can choose to edit the report by clicking customize or save as a new report. Alright. I'm gonna bring us back here. One thing you'll also see we're not gonna do, a deep dive into this today, but just want to make sure that everyone here is aware that Hubspot does have analytics suites. So based on whether you're looking at marketing reports, looking to create sales reports, service, or commerce, you can see so for example, if I come into the sales analytics suite, there are different categories of types of reports here. So if I wanted to see different activity reports, remember activities in Hubspot are action logs.

Danielle Velt
So I can see all of the completed activities or completed action logs, and Hubspot already has essentially spun up a report for me to show me the data that is applicable here, and I can still change filters, and I can customize this further. It's just an easy way to be able to grab a quick report, throw it on a dashboard, rather than having to fully create that report from scratch. Alright. I'm going to bring us back to the dashboard section. So we were just in reports. We're going back to dashboards, and remember as well, if you haven't updated your home page just yet and it is still the dashboards page, as I mentioned yesterday, you can click on the Hubspot icon in the top left here to be led back to the dashboard section.

Danielle Velt
So if I do that because my home page is dashboards, I'm still here. Alright. So I am going to use the dashboard that I am currently on as one example, but I want to also call out some of the other, dashboards that are created here. So we have our lead routing dashboard. We also do have our AM desktop. We have b to a SM desktop. So you'll see different reports on these dashboards, and one more that I wanna call out is CTMSM desktop. So whenever you load a new dashboard, the data is going to load for you here, and you will see the data as it relates to your numbers.

Danielle Velt
And, actually, I'm I'm going to actually keep us on just as an example, I'm gonna bring us back to the lead routing dashboard as I mentioned before. So we wanna understand how we can actually navigate these different dashboards. So we can choose a different dashboard up at the top, but how do we actually filter this data if we need to? So similar to on contacts, companies, and deals, how we can add quick filters and advanced filters, we can do the exact same thing here for dashboards. So I can add quick filters. I can also add advanced filters. The biggest thing to note here, and this is something that I mentioned yesterday when we were filtering on contacts and companies, is that with quick filters, there's an implied and in between all of those criteria.

Danielle Velt
Right? So if I filter for myself as the owner of the data on this dashboard, maybe I I am the sales manager that I am filtering for, and I'm also filtering for a specific time frame for all of the data on this dashboard, there's an implied and If I go into advanced filters and I add a filter right here and I choose sales manager is any of, and then I choose myself and click apply filter, I can add another filter. Let's say, create date of the business partner is and I'll say this year and then apply filter. So it will tell you if there's an and or if there is the ability to choose or in between this criteria.

Danielle Velt
But it should function the same way whether we're using advanced filters or quick filters otherwise, and I can add another quick filter from right here on the right hand side. So maybe I do wanna see sales manager, and then I can click customize once I've selected my property there, and best practice here would be to make sure that we're labeling this the same way as the field is actually labeled in Hubspot just so that no one is confused by that, and then when I save that, now I can see over here this is one of my quick filters, and it's already filtered to myself. But I can also change this, and I can filter for somebody completely different, and once I do that, I click apply, and I should see the data refresh on this dashboard immediately because I just changed the filters, I've changed what I am trying to see on this dashboard. There might not be any data, especially if we're in our testing environment, so just be aware of that. But I'm gonna go back to filtering for myself in this case.

Danielle Velt
Alright, and just so that we have the lay of the land as well, in terms of how to navigate dashboards and reports that are on dashboards, please note at any point in time, this will depend on your permissions if you are able to edit different reports. But, just note that everything that I'm going through right now will be reflective of if you have edit permissions in dashboards and reports. So up in the top right, I can click on actions, and I can click on clone. So this allows me to actually clone this entire dashboard, which, again, is just a collection of reports, and I have an important decision to make. I can choose to either create new copies of every single report that is on this dashboard or use the original reports on the new dashboard.

Danielle Velt
So that's one important thing to keep in mind here is that one report can live on multiple dashboards. So I can keep the same original reports on my new dashboard. It just depends on what your purpose is here. If we're trying to be cognizant of keeping our report creation count low in the Hubspot account overall, best practice would be to keep the original reports and just have a new dashboard, and you can also choose who can access this dashboard. So should everyone be allowed to view and edit? Should everyone just be allowed to view, or do I need to assign this to just my team? Right, and then I can choose next and choose my team. Right?

Danielle Velt
So if I need to see and find my team here, I should it should be very easy to do that and choose what the access is. Alright. I can also view the dashboard details at any time. So if I need to change the name of the dashboard, that's where I would do this. I can also change the owner. So the owner has the ability to choose whether the dashboard is private or shared and who it's shared with, and if needed, I can change the brand that this is associated with as well and set a description on the dashboard and even show that description directly on the dashboard. I can also view an activity log. So what changes have been made to this dashboard and when, can be really helpful for admins to be able to see that.

Danielle Velt
I can also do full screen view. So if I want to just block out the rest of the noise that's around me with the navigation and everything in Hubspot, really easy to just make this full screen for whether it's a laptop screen, a monitor, etcetera, and I can click escape on my keyboard to get out of that. I can also hard refresh the data on this report. So Hubspot should automatically refresh each of these reports every couple of minutes. It's actually fairly quick and automatic. But if you feel the need to refresh all the data, and just do a hard refresh, you can do that, and here is where I can remove or set this dashboard as my default.

Danielle Velt
So I'll remove it really quick, and now I don't see default up in the top left. But I can also click on actions again, and now I see set as default. So very, very easy to go to the right dashboard and then set that as your default, and I can also delete a dashboard. So, again, remember that dashboards and reports are technically independent of each other even though you can put reports on a dashboard. So I can choose to delete all of the reports on the dashboard or just delete the dashboard, which does not delete all of the reports. Remember, a report can just live in the report library if this was the only dashboard it was on.

Danielle Velt
So just one big call to keep in mind there, and then if I want to share this dashboard, I can copy the URL and send it to anybody else who's a user in Hubspot. I can send it I don't have to send it through Hubspot. I can actually send it through Slack, and share the dashboard that way, and then that user can open it up inside of Hubspot from that URL, or I can choose to email this dashboard. So you can send a one off email, or I could actually make this a recurring email. So if I choose a recurring email, this is where I can then choose, what the email nickname is. So this is just internal to you, and then what is the subject and the email message?

Danielle Velt
So those are going to be public to everybody who is an internal recipient to that email, and then Hubspot will let you choose whether you want that dashboard emailed to you daily, weekly, or monthly, and at what time of day, and then if you want to have an attachable, download file, it will ask you what you would like here. So based on the images in that dashboard or based on the data, what is possible there, and do you want to send the dashboard with or without the current dashboard filters? Right? So those are the quick filters and the advanced filters at the top. Alright, and then up in the very top left or excuse me, the very top right, we can click on add content, this orange button, and this is where I can choose to either create a new report from scratch at the bottom here, choose a report from the report library or that analytics suite that we looked at, choose to add image or text.

Danielle Velt
So this is a a slightly newer addition, which is really nice. If you need to add, just text to a dashboard, maybe it's, instructions on how to read a dashboard, you can add that there, and you can also embed external content, which has been very helpful too. So if you want to actually embed a Google Sheet view, a Youtube video, etcetera, there's a lot of different options here, and if I choose other content, I just need to make sure I have an embed code here.

Danielle Velt
And on any of these reports, we have a few things that we can do as well. So you'll see dashboard filters are applied, and it tells you which dashboard filters are applied here, which is really helpful. What I can also do so if I want to see what data is actually being calculated here on the report, I'm actually gonna use this report here, the number of partners per sales manager by region as an example. I can click directly on the data to see which records in Hubspot are being accounted for here. Because with Hubspot reporting, it's really just looking at all of the records, right, between all of these different objects to determine what should show up in the report.

Danielle Velt
So I can see here all the different business partners that are showing up in this segment of the report because I'm looking by region. So in The Caribbean, how many business partners are in that region versus a different region. So really helpful to be able to click or even just hover over the data, and then I can also click on this icon up in the top right here, this little edit icon. It will bring up a pop up so that you can choose to make some adjustments here. If you wanna fully go into the report editor, you can click on the customize button at the bottom here. But if you just need to see this a little more closely, this is a little preview section, and you can also make, again, edits here if I wanted to change this to a vertical bar and then update this existing report.

Danielle Velt
I can do that, or you can actually save it as a copy as a new report if you would like to, I'm gonna cancel, though, because I don't wanna make that change, so I'll leave without saving, and then I can also click on the 3 dots icon here. I can hard refresh the data in this one report, clone this report, choose to rename it. I can export the data from the report. I can share this one report, so that's similar to sharing the dashboard via a link or an email. I can move this report. So if I want to just move it from one dashboard to another, so it would leave this this dashboard and be added to another, I can do that, or I can change the owner of this one report because there are owners of reports and owners of dashboards.

Danielle Velt
I can choose to add this report to another dashboard, so it would stay on this dashboard and be added to the next. I can just remove this report from this dashboard. Maybe it only lives on this dashboard, so I'd remove it, and then it still exists in that report library section that we looked at, or I can delete this report, which would mean it does not live in the report library. It has been deleted, and at any time as well in the bottom right, I'm going to see there's some dots here. There's, like, a triangle icon essentially. So I can click on that, and I can drag my report in whatever way I need to if I want to change how big this report shows up on this dashboard, which is really helpful, and I can also, in the top left, drag to move the report.

Danielle Velt
So if I want to change the order of these reports, it's very easy to do. Alright. Once again, that was a lot of content. I'm going to have us pause here, and I wanna bring us actually back to our slideshow here. So, again, these resources that you see in front of you will be shared after our training today internally, and I know we only have a few minutes left again, but I do want to open it up in case we have any q and a that we want to address in our last few minutes here.

Danielle Velt
Anyone has any big questions, we can give everybody a minute.

Daria Klassen
Betty, thank you very much for the session. I think the question will come as soon as the team will have accesses to the systems that they don't have at the moment, and team, I would like to take the moment to comment on this stuff. So the sessions that you were invited to yesterday and today are a kind of the early bird overview of the system because the access rights are planned to be provided mid gen in portions by the sales team. So it's gonna be happening gradually so that we kind of make it as smooth as possible. All the communications will be happening internally, so you and your teams will be warned in advance, and when it comes to the training sessions and all the resources so first of all, the resources from this particular training sessions for T and D and for the leadership, they will be provided to you, I think, tomorrow.

Daria Klassen
Okay? I will reach out to you and share everything which was discussed yesterday and today, and when it comes to the follow up teams training, they will be happening gradually in January once the holidays break is over. So all the communications will be happening in advance one week before. But if you have any questions, any concerns, feel free to reach out to us in the or round trip dedicated channels, and we will be navigating you further. Okay, team?
