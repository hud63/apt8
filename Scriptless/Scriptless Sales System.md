Based on the sources, Josh Lyons' sales system, particularly in the discovery phase, is built on a foundation of **scriptless selling** and having a **truthful, authentic, no BS conversation**. There is **no fixed script or rigid sequence of questions** to follow. Instead, the questioning process is **dynamic, non-linear, and driven by curiosity** and the need to understand the individual prospect.

*Go for pain/problem first*  
*Data \> Pain \> Why ?*  
*Billiard ball analogy of discovery phase*  
*Instinct will guide to right question \> pause \> deliver w/o emotion/judgement*

*results, inputs, meaning of results*  
*Why do you want to X \< Why are you not willing to never X?*

However, the sources do highlight the *purpose* and *types* of questions used and a general flow based on the information needed to help the prospect reach their own conclusion. The overarching pattern is to **get to the truth**, **build a clear map of their situation**, **identify the root cause**, and **build an undeniable case** for why they need to change.

* Why   
* why now  
* Tell me a story  
* Why did that affect you  
  * Was there a recent moment?  
* How much longer  
* Why us

Here are some specific questions or types of questions discussed and their general purpose or placement within the conversation flow, though the exact wording and order will always adapt to the specific prospect:

**Core Conversational Loop ("Ping-Pong"):** This is a fundamental pattern that happens *after* a prospect responds to almost *any* question:

* **Ask** a question.  
* Prospect **Responds**.  
* You **Say back** to them or summarize what they said, ideally using their specific language to ensure high clarity.  
* **Pause** for confirmation that you understood correctly and that they shared the whole truth. This shows you are listening and allows them to correct or add more.

**General Flow and Question Types (Not a Rigid Sequence):**

1. **Opening the Discovery:**

   * Start with a broad question to get the prospect talking about their main challenges or current situation.  
   * *Example Opening Question:* "In your opinion what is the biggest challenge you're facing right now with \[relevant area\]?"

2. **Initial Data Gathering & Clarification:**

   * Listen intently to their initial response. Note key points and anything that seems vague or doesn't make sense.  
   * Ask clarifying questions to translate low-resolution, vague statements into specific, high-clarity details and examples. You need facts, figures, and specific instances.  
   * *Examples of Clarifying/Digging Questions (context dependent):*  
     * "What actually happened with \[specific event they mentioned\]?"  
     * "In what way was \[something they described, e.g., 'unworthy'\]?"  
     * "How many \[times/examples\] has this happened?"  
     * "How much time and effort have you invested in \[activity\]?"  
     * "How long does \[situation\] typically last?"  
     * "What exactly do you mean by \[vague term, e.g., 'toxic environment'\]?"  
     * "What have you been seeing as far as \[opportunities/situation\]?"  
   * Explore timelines – it doesn't necessarily matter if you start with the present and work back, or start from the beginning and work forward, as long as you cover everything needed to understand the full picture and focus on what's relevant.

3. **Uncovering the Core Pain and Consequences:**

   * As you gather data, dig deeper into the severity of the situation and the consequences it's having on their life (time, money, emotions, other life areas).  
   * Get the prospect to relive experiences to connect with the frustration of their situation.

4. **Identifying the "Why Now?":**

   * This is a crucial point in the discovery. If the problem has existed for a while, you need to understand why they are seeking a solution *today*. Ask what has changed or what makes this a priority now.  
   * *Examples of "Why Now?" Questions:*  
     * "What shifted \[timeframe they mentioned, e.g., 6 months\] ago?"  
     * "Why has it just taken \[trigger event, e.g., an ad\] coming across your screen to actually make a difference?"  
     * "What's actually changed for you to be here?"  
     * "Why has it taken \[timeframe, e.g., 5 years\] to figure this out?"  
     * "If not now then when?"

5. **Establishing Ownership and Challenging Rationalizations:**

   * Guide the prospect to see that their current situation is a result of their own choices or actions, not just external factors. If they rationalize or blame, challenge this directly but without judgment. Present the data you've gathered and ask them to connect it back to their responsibility.  
   * *Examples of Ownership/Challenging Questions:*  
     * "Why do you think that is?" (When they state a problem or situation)  
     * "So you've been applying for six months, you haven't had a single interview, and in 4 months someone else landed a role... what is your current belief now around the market is too saturated?" (Directly challenging their blame based on data)  
     * "When you'd been applying for six months... how did that make you feel or what did that make you think?"  
     * "Why hasn't it been possible for you?"  
     * "Why not just continue doing that \[what they're doing on their own\]?"  
     * "How much longer are you looking to do this on your own?"

6. **Exploring Priorities (Often Intertwined with Pain/Why Now):**

   * Understand where this problem or solution fits within their current priorities.  
   * *Examples of Priority Questions:*  
     * "Where are your priorities now?"  
     * "Where do your priorities lie now?"  
     * "How much of a priority is \[specific thing, e.g., your kids\] now?"  
     * "What are you prioritizing now?"

7. **Understanding Motivation and Perceived Solutions (Can come later):**

   * Understand what they are looking for in a solution and why they might be considering your specific offer or service.  
   * *Examples:*  
     * "Why \[this specific person/company/offer\]?"  
     * "What are you actually looking for when it comes to a solution...?"

8. **Tying Down the Logic and Challenging Inaction:**

   * Once you have a clear picture of the pain, consequence, why now, and their ownership, you challenge the prospect on continuing down the path they're on. This is where you connect their situation to the cost of inaction.  
   * *Examples of "How Much Longer Are You Willing...?" Questions (Phrased around the consequence of inaction):*  
     * "How much longer are you willing to be in a position where this is happening?"  
     * "How much longer are you willing to not stand out?" (Note the emphasis on "willing" rather than "want")  
     * "Are you ready to stop not standing out?" (Note the emphasis on "ready")  
     * "How much longer do you want to live life like that?"  
     * "How much longer do you want to continue with blank?"  
     * "How much longer are you willing to not have the help that you need to get all of that solved?"

The **"order"** is not sequential questions 1, 2, 3\. It's more like a skillful boxer adapting to their opponent. You start broad, and wherever the prospect's response reveals something significant (pain, rationalization, confusion, "doesn't make sense"), you dig deeper there until you understand it fully, even if it takes multiple layers of questions. You prioritize tackling major blockages or inconsistencies as they arise rather than saving them for later. The depth and type of questioning needed change depending on the prospect's openness and tendency to rationalize.

The key is that the **prospects have all the answers** regarding their pain and ownership; your role is to ask the right questions in a human, curious, and detached way to help them uncover their own truth and see the reality of their situation clearly.

Based on the sources, Josh Lyons' approach to questions in sales role plays is less about a rigid script and more about having an authentic, curious conversation focused on uncovering the prospect's reality. The "order" is not fixed but flows based on the information the prospect provides and where clarification or deeper understanding is needed. The goal is always to **get to the truth**, build a clear map of their situation, help them see the root cause, and make the case for change undeniable *to them*.

Here are examples of specific questions or types of questions mentioned or demonstrated, grouped by their general purpose within the conversation, keeping in mind that the flow is dynamic:

**Core Conversational Loop ("Ping-Pong"):**

This is a fundamental pattern used *after* a prospect responds to almost any question to ensure clarity and show you're listening. It often involves repeating back or summarizing what they said and pausing for confirmation.

* Ask a question.  
* Prospect responds.  
* **Say back** to them or summarize what they said, ideally using their specific language.  
* **Pause** for confirmation that you understood correctly and that they shared the whole truth.

**General Flow and Question Types (Not a Rigid Sequence):**

1. **Opening the Discovery:**

   * Start with a broad question to get the prospect talking about their main challenges or current situation in the relevant area of their life.  
   * Get their opinion on their biggest issue.  
   * *Examples:*  
     * "In your own opinion what would you say is the **biggest challenge** that you are facing currently in your \[relevant area\] right now?"  
     * "What's actually **going on** in your \[relevant area\] life right now?"

2. **Initial Data Gathering & Clarification:**

   * Dig deeper into the details of their situation. Avoid generalizations and seek specific examples, facts, and figures.  
   * Clarify any vague terms they use to ensure high resolution understanding.  
   * Explore timelines and processes, focusing on recent, specific instances.  
   * *Examples of Clarifying/Digging Questions (context dependent):*  
     * "In what way is she/it \[vague term, e.g., shy, unworthy, toxic\]?"  
     * "How do you **mean by** \[vague term, e.g., worthy, comparable\]?"  
     * "What **exactly** do you mean by \[vague term\]?"  
     * "What **else** \[is on that list of criteria/comparability\]?" (Used to dig deeper on a specific point)  
     * "What **actually happened** with \[specific event they mentioned\]?"  
     * "What did you **do the last time** you \[specific action, e.g., trained legs\]?"  
     * "What did you **do the time before** \[specific action\]?" (Exploring recent history)  
     * "**Last week how many** \[specific metric, e.g., leads\] did you get?" (Focus on specific, recent data)  
     * "In the **last 30 days how many** \[specific metric, e.g., dates\] have you gone on?" (Quantifying recent activity)  
     * "**12 months ago in an average month how many** \[specific product/metric\] did you sell?" (Quantifying historical data for comparison)  
     * "**Ballpark the number for an average month** how many \[specific metric\] did you make total?" (Getting estimated figures)  
     * "**Ballpark out of those \[total number\] how many** did you sell at \[price\]?" (Getting estimated breakdown)  
     * "Between those two times **how many times were you in \[pain/issue\]**?" (Quantifying frequency of issue)  
     * "**How many times has this happened**?" (Simple way to quantify frequency)  
     * "**How long has this been going on**?" (Timeline)  
     * "**How's that process going for you**?" (Regarding their current efforts)  
     * "**How much time** are you putting in \[on current solution\]?" (Quantifying effort)  
     * "**How much effort** \[on current solution\]?" (Quantifying effort)  
     * "What are the **results** \[of your current efforts\]?" (Quantifying outcome)  
     * "Where did you **get the pain**?" (Specific detail about a physical issue)  
     * "**Scale of 1 to 10 how bad** was it \[at its peak\]?" (Quantifying pain \- context dependent)  
     * "What have you been **seeing as far as \[opportunities/situation\]**?" (Current market/situation data)

3. **Uncovering the Core Pain and Consequences:**

   * Connect the objective data and specific examples to the subjective experience and real-world impact on the prospect's life (time, money, emotions, relationships, identity). Get them to relive experiences to deepen the pain connection.  
   * *Examples:*  
     * "**How did that make you feel** or what did that make you think?" (After detailing a negative experience)  
     * "**How do you feel about that** \[situation/data point\]?" (Timing dependent \- ask when the situation is clear)  
     * "**How much longer do you want to flush \[specific amount of money\] down the drain** a year?" (Connecting data to financial consequence)  
     * "**How much longer do you want to have \[specific timeframe\] left of your dream** still having breath inside of its lungs?" (Connecting data to life consequence)  
     * "How do you **feel every time in the last week \[number\] times when you've walked past that not looking at it**?" (Connecting specific behavior/frequency to emotion)  
     * "**Why do you feel that way**?" (Digging into the root cause of the emotion)

4. **Identifying the "Why Now?":**

   * Understand what specifically prompted them to seek a solution at this particular moment, especially if the problem has existed for a while. Challenge the delay.  
   * *Examples:*  
     * "**Why now**?"  
     * "What has **changed**?"  
     * "**Why are you reaching out today**?"  
     * "Out of curiosity **what's changed**?"  
     * "**Why have you now realized that** \[the current approach isn't working\]?"  
     * "What has **led to that realization**?"  
     * "What led to that **sudden realization or that moment of clarity**?"  
     * "What **shifted \[timeframe they mentioned, e.g., 6 months\] ago**?"  
     * "Why has it just taken \[trigger event, e.g., an ad\] coming across your screen to actually make a difference?"  
     * "Why has it taken \[timeframe, e.g., 5 years\] to figure this out?"  
     * "If not now then when?" (An implicit challenge to continuing to wait)  
     * "**Why is it taking you \[timeframe, e.g., 4-5 years\] to get on this phone call**?" (Directly but curiously challenging the delay based on stated facts)

5. **Establishing Ownership and Challenging Rationalizations:**

   * Guide the prospect to see that their current situation is influenced by their own choices or lack of action, rather than solely external factors. Challenge excuses directly but without judgment, using the data you've gathered.  
   * *Examples:*  
     * "**Why do you think that is**?" (When they state a problem or situation)  
     * "**Why do you think this is happening**?" (When they state a situation)  
     * "So you've been applying for six months, you haven't had a single interview, and in 4 months someone else landed a role... **what is your current belief now around the market is too saturated**?" (Directly challenging their external blame based on data)  
     * "Why **hasn't it been possible** for you?"  
     * "**Why not just continue doing** what you're currently doing?" (Challenging their current strategy)  
     * "Why not just **do \[their current attempt, e.g., the peloton and nutrition study\]**?" (Specific challenge to their current method)  
     * "**Why not just do that again**?" (Key question in situations where they rely on luck or ineffective past methods)  
     * "**What's different now**?" (Follow-up after challenging their past method)  
     * **Continually asking "Why?", "What?", "When?", or "How?"** to dig deeper and tie down logic until they acknowledge their ownership.

6. **Exploring Priorities:**

   * Understand the importance of solving this specific problem within the context of their overall life and goals.  
   * *Examples:*  
     * "**Where are your priorities now**?"  
     * "Where do your **priorities lie now**?"  
     * "**How of a priority is** \[specific thing, e.g., your kids\] now?"  
     * "What are you **prioritizing now**?"

7. **Understanding Motivation and Perceived Solutions:**

   * Explore what they ideally envision as a solution and why they might be considering help or your specific offer.  
   * *Examples:*  
     * "What do you **want now as far as your ideal role regarding \[specific criteria\]**?" (Exploring ideal future state to contrast with present reality)  
     * "What are you **actually looking for when it comes to a solution**?"  
     * "**Why \[this specific person/company/offer\]**?"

8. **Tying Down the Logic and Challenging Inaction (Cost of Inaction):**

   * This is a critical phase where you synthesize the data, pain, consequences, and ownership to highlight the cost of *not* changing. Frame this around their *willingness* or *readiness* to continue experiencing the negative consequences, rather than just asking if they *want* the pain to stop.  
   * *Examples:*  
     * "**How much longer are you willing to be in a position where this is happening**?" (Uses 'willing')  
     * "**How much longer are you willing to not stand out**?" (Uses 'willing', links to a specific consequence)  
     * "**Are you ready to stop not standing out**?" (Uses 'ready', links to a specific consequence)  
     * "**How much longer are you willing to continue with blank**?" (Uses 'willing' and 'continue')  
     * "**Are you ready to change that**?" (Uses 'ready', frames as a commitment question)  
     * "**How much longer are you willing to not have the help that you need to get all of that solved**?" (Uses 'willing', connects inaction to lack of necessary help)  
     * "Are you going to **continue to be the worst version of yourself or the best version**?" (Challenges their future identity based on the choice of inaction)

The emphasis is on **listening deeply**, being **genuinely curious**, and adapting your questions dynamically based on the prospect's responses to build a clear picture and guide them to their own conclusions about the need for change.

# P\_C & O\_R 

Based on the sources, Josh Lyons emphasizes a core sales concept that he often illustrates visually, depicting the relationship between a prospect's **Pain/Consequence** and their **Ownership/Responsibility** for that situation. This connection is crucial for building a strong case for change and making the decision to move forward with a solution seem logically necessary.

Here's a detailed breakdown of what he's talking and drawing about:

1. **The Pain or Consequence Side:**

   * This represents the **negative impact** or the **cost** of the prospect's current situation. It's about quantifying and detailing the suffering or losses they are experiencing or will experience if things don't change.  
   * This side is built by gathering **specific, factual data** through detailed questioning during the discovery process. It's not about vague feelings but concrete numbers and relatable experiences.  
   * Key metrics often revolve around **dollars** (financial cost) and **time** (wasted effort, duration of the problem).  
   * Examples from the discussion include:  
     * The **potential loss of $300,000 over four years** due to not landing a higher-paying role (calculated as the difference between their likely current salary and their desired salary multiplied by time).  
     * The **time commitment** they've already invested, quantified as **960 hours** spent applying for jobs over six months (40 hours/week x 24 weeks).  
     * The **money already spent** from savings, framed both as a dollar amount ($15,000) and a percentage of their total savings (30% out of $50,000).  
     * The **daily financial cost** of their situation ($233 a day based on estimated monthly expenses).  
     * The **emotional and mental toll**, described as feeling worn out and taking the toxic work environment feeling home in the past.  
     * The **frustration and anxiety** stemming from the lack of results (no interviews for desired roles) despite significant effort.  
     * The potential future reality of having to **settle for a lower-paying job** ($100k vs $150k-$200k).  
   * Josh refers to these data points as "legs to the chair," emphasizing the need to gather enough quantifiable and specific details to make the prospect's situation **unequivocally difficult** and eliminate any room for rationalization based on incomplete information. The more legs the chair has, the more stable (or undeniable) the reality of their pain becomes.

2. **The Ownership or Responsibility Side:**

   * This represents the prospect's **accountability** for their current situation. It focuses on the **inputs** they control – their actions, choices, beliefs, or lack of effective strategy.  
   * The goal here is to guide the prospect to recognize that the problem isn't solely due to external factors (like "the market") but is significantly influenced by **their own decisions and behaviors**.  
   * This is achieved by asking questions that challenge their assumptions, excuses, and past actions, prompting them to acknowledge their role in the outcome.  
   * Examples from the discussion include:  
     * Challenging the belief that the market is "too saturated" by highlighting that others are succeeding in it, leading the prospect to question if the issue is *their* process, not the market.  
     * Leading the prospect to the realization that **their resume isn't standing out** – shifting the focus from the market to their application strategy.  
     * Highlighting that they **haven't worked with a professional** or done anything "extraordinary" to differentiate themselves despite trying for months.  
     * Acknowledging their choice to **continue trying on their own** despite a lack of results.  
   * In the drawing, this side often represents "them" or "you," symbolizing the prospect's personal responsibility.

3. **Connecting the Two (The Middle):**

   * The essential part of the concept and the drawing is explicitly **connecting the Pain/Consequence to the Ownership/Responsibility**.  
   * The objective is to demonstrate to the prospect that **their specific actions, inactions, or choices** (ownership) are the **direct cause** of the pain, consequences, and costs they are facing.  
   * This connection is solidified in the summary by linking the detailed pain points directly to the prospect's admitted ownership. For instance, "It's costing you X dollars and Y hours *because* your resume isn't standing out."  
   * This synthesis makes the **cost of inaction** undeniable *to the prospect*. It's not just a general cost of the problem; it's the specific, personal cost of *their choice* to continue operating in a certain way or not taking specific actions.  
   * This leads to the powerful closing question, which is framed around the prospect's choice (ownership), linked to the consequences: "How much longer are you **willing** to **not stand out** (ownership), knowing that it is costing you **$300,000 over the next four years, 960 hours of your time, burning through 30% of your savings, and costing $7,000 a month** (pain/consequence)?"  
   * The use of "willing" versus "want" is highlighted as crucial – "willing" implies a choice and ownership, whereas "want" can elicit resistance or a simple passive desire ("Of course, I don't *want* this, but I don't control it").

By effectively gathering detailed data on both the pain/consequences and the ownership/responsibility, and then explicitly connecting them, the closer builds a compelling case where **not** moving forward with a solution (which addresses the ownership side, like helping them stand out) becomes "literal absurdity" for the prospect. They see that their ongoing pain is a direct result of *their* choices, and therefore, changing their choices (getting help to stand out) is the logical path to resolving the problem and stopping the consequences. This approach moves the prospect past blaming external factors and towards taking action based on their own recognized responsibility.

# ROI Offer Sequence

so in your opinion Jeremy what's the biggest challenge you're having with making money in your Guta business right now

*um I mean there's there's competition out there there's a Amish guy that's charging about $5 a foot out there um and there's I mean I'm I know that there's business out there I'm I'm in Western New York so I'm between two major cities out there so I know that there's business out there but um you know and I'm just not really getting my name out there so I need to get my name out there*

Okay so there's business out there sounds like it's going to your competitors and because you don't have your name out there that business is not coming to you

*yeah*

Okay so in terms of business that that did come to you how much business in terms of a dollar amount did you have in the last seven days

*um I don't think no I don't think I had any sorry bus yeah yeah it's you know it's New York it's it's cold right now we're you know Upstate New York everything's kind of frozen over so you know in the last month we haven't done anything we have kind of our busy season which is like late spring through summer and a little bit through fall and then you know when it gets cold around November December it slows down again*

Okay so you haven't generated any money in the last 30 days

*no that's correct*

You you mentioned this stuff about Seasons you've also mentioned competitors is there any businesses in New York that are generating any money during these winter months

*A lot of these businesses I believe are at a standstill you know when it when there's a foot of snow on the ground you know it's kind of hard to you can't really do this kind of work in that you know occasionally we might get a warm day here or there but you can't you know do roofing and stuff like that in you know 30 degree temperatures or less*

So what are you doing in your business to be able to generate income during the time when you can't actually fulfill the service are you doing you know hey here's a special offer which you can you know uh cash in on in the summer are you selling you know gift vouchers or or any other type of make money during the slow time um you know product or offer or anything or you just saying hey we we'll just wave the White Flag we can't do anything

*Yeah I mean we try to do some like gutter cleaning stuff out there if possible but again you know if the gutters are frozen we can't really do that much so we are sorry sorry hello*

to be clear I'm not saying to do the work because I understand that you know it's I what I'm saying is you could be still selling you could have people that are going out to people's houses saying hey now's the perfect time for you to book in for the summer because in the summer we're super busy and so we're actually going around to everybody's house right now in the winter so that you don't miss out on the opportunity that another summer goes by where you don't make any improvements to your gutters do you do anything like do you have sales for

*Yeah no we're not doing that that's a good idea*

Well that's probably why you're on the call with me okay so you haven't got any way to you haven't made any money for the last month and you don't actually have anything in place to be able to resolve that you know for this winter or next winter it doesn't seem like

*no*

Okay is that something that you'd like to resolve

*Yeah*

Okay got it so no money for the last month what about the month before how much did you generate the the month before

*Yeah no January uh nothing and then I think in the first half of December we did 10,000*

Okay so zero for the last 60 days and then yeah $10,000 the month before during those last 60 days have you had any outgoing money like staff or software or premises okay

*Yes*

Yeah how much have you lost over cuz I mean if you haven't made any money you've literally been losing money how much money have you lost in the last 30 days

*It's a good question I haven't thought about that but uh yeah we do have expenses that are about $10,000 a month so that every every month uh yeah about $8,000 on average*

So for the last 60 days you have your inability to have your name out there to have any type of sales training that helps you sell during the slower months has cost you $16,000 in the last 60 days

*Yeah yeah*

When when you now have the awareness of that how do you feel

*Uh I feel like you know we'll we'll make it up in the busy season you know like we'll do over and above you know and uh it'll it'll kind of end up evening out in the wash it's like a feast or famine kind of things right*

I mean is that what you want do you want your business to be that you only make money for certain months of the year and you just lose money the other months of the year and then you're constantly playing catchup with Feast of family is that how you want your business to be

*No I definitely want to be more consistent if anything you know being even if I could just break even let's say on the slow months you know and and then still make more money in the busier months that that would be better obviously it'd be nice to be profitable all year round I'm sure there's other companies that are you know yep makes sense*

Okay so your average expenses per month is 8,000 and we've talked now about the couple of months where there was no money coming in just money going out the month before that was $10,000 I want to get a clear picture of kind of a 12 month cycle here so during the last year when it was the busy period what did you generate I guess we could average it on an average monthly basis during the peak season

*Yeah I mean from we really started focusing on gutters in June and we did 150 from June through January or through through December so you know there was obvious yeah six months yeah*

Okay so 150,000 divided by six about 20 25,000 something like that

*Yeah it is 25,000*

Okay so averaging $25,000 a month and that's income and during those months because you've got now people out there doing work is your expenses the same 8,000 or is it more

*Uh it's a it's a little bit more I'd probably say it's around that $10,000 mark uh 10 well maybe 12 yeah*

Okay let's say 10 to 12 so during the the season when you get the most amount of business that you ever do get in the year you're profiting just about $13,000 a month and that's for about six months is that accurate

*Yeah*

The other six months how many of those other six months is it the the zero zero incoming

*Well it's probably mainly just about three or four months in the winter time okay you know four months is yeah*

perfect I I'll come to the next bit in second I'm just trying to keep track of everything sure sure um so four months you're losing $8,000 a month so that's $32,000 in the negative and then what about the other two months is that the 10,000 coming in

*Yeah yeah okay so that's 20,000 coming in minus let's just call it $10,000 a month so it's basically zero for those months it's just break even does that make sense*

Yeah okay so 150,000 minus 32,000 not including the break even months because it's no positive or negative does that mean your business in the last 12 months did uh 118,000

*No that that can't be right I my math must be off because I know that he said on the role play that it was about 25% you know cuz he said on 150,000 I think he said he was around 25% um because at 450 he was thinking he'd be about $100,000 so I'm sorry Josh my pulling numbers out of my ass for the role play*

Exactly let let's just go with the number I said because the number doesn't matter what matters is you being able to see how I'm piecing everything together okay so okay so $118,000 now what I then want to know so that's what you're making how are you getting that business that you are getting during the summer months

*Yeah I've got a couple of pole barn companies that we're working with they've got about six or seven Crews and uh we're you know we're doing the bulk of our business with them and their big jobs you know their 100 foot you know jobs straight runs and stuff and then we've got another company that we do some residential work with the roofer*

Okay you got the pull bar so that's and the the residential with the roofer so those are the only two ways right now that you get your name out

*Yeah right now but we did just buy some signs so now that we're going to put those signs once those are printed off they should be coming in today as a matter of fact um that whenever we go do our any business we'll put the signs up out in the areas that we're working with and hopefully get our name out there a little more*

Okay so you've got a a new thing with the signs um out of curiosity did you book in this call with me after you'd already ordered the signs

*Yeah yeah*

Okay so so what was the reason that you didn't want to just try out the signs first and see how that goes you still wanted to potentially work with me to increase your sales

*I'm just trying to I I want to do as much as possible you know um just*

Why why is that why why not just crush it with the signs

*Well not sure if it if it would um how do you mean you know  Well I'm just you know I saw your ad and and uh you know I figured you know you might have some information*

Oh no no I sorry not about the ad sorry I know we cross lines there.  why don't you think the signs are going to solve this problem for you

*Uh well it's it's just an unknown it's just very passive so I mean I think it's just I think it's just one of those things where you know every little bit counts I think it's uh you know probably going to be you know 20% of the income might come from signs you know but I'm looking to not just add 20% in my business I'm trying to look to you know triple and quadruple my business*

Why why is that the number that you're aiming for 3 to 4X

*Well yeah I mean I'm trying to get up to where this thing does about three you know 750 a year you know we did 150 over those six months and I'm hoping that this year I'll be able to do you know uh 450 or 500 but I I think that there's you know if we can learn how to you know sell better and just get our name out there more and do you know get ads and stuff going that there's no reason why we couldn't do 750 plus*

Okay so was there kind of a a turning point for you where you realized that sure you're trying things with the signs but was there a turning point where you realized we need to get trained on how to sell better and get our name out there in a more active way because you mentioned the signs are very passive, was there a turning point where that happened in the business

*Yeah I was talking with my sons about it uh you know the other week you know that you know it's a new year and we're trying to you know uh talk about what we want to accomplish with this business you know so I hadn't really thought about it like that but you know it's uh yeah we're just I just know that you know I want to grow this thing I know it can do better*

What are your son's involvement with the business

*Um they they work for me uh one works in the construction company and then one works on in the gutter company as as labor right now*

Okay and so you had this conversation with your sons and you know you said we we can grow this we should grow this we need to grow this had you never wanted to grow the business prior to that conversation

*Oh no I mean we've we've always wanted to grow it it was just you know taking a look at the year-end numbers you know I and I happen to just I happen to come across your ad so you know it was uh it just good timing*

Well you know there there is such a thing as Divine timing but I'm sure you've come across ads before of people that are offering to help your sales offering to help get your name out there marketing people things like that right so what was it about when you looked at your end because you said you looked at the end of year numbers and that was seems significant for you as far as a turning point to we need to learn how to sell better and get our name out there what what happened when you looked at the numbers

*Uh just knowing that I want to make this bigger for my son to take over you know um you know I mean we just need to we only have two companies you know two big companies that we're working with and so just wanting to add more companies to work with and and ultimately being able to get away from not just being the subcontract work but also being able to do the residential work you know and being able to charge what we want to charge*

Okay uh you mentioned you your son to take over the business take over in what way

*Oh I mean in in about three or four years you know I want them to be I want to be able to retire you know I'm 43 right now and uh you know I you know there my sons are like 22 and 24 and and want I'm just wanting to get them set up to where they can you know have a profitable business that they can you know that'll put them in a better position than than you know when I started started it okay*

And I mean the business is profitable it generates $150,000 $18,000 a year why not just give them that business

*Well you know instead of them just you know trying to get by and and struggle you know uh I want them to uh be in a better position okay*

so you don't want them to just get by and you don't want them to to to struggle I mean I understand that your sons work for you but why do you want them to be doing more than getting by and you know not struggling but prospering by having this business rather than them you know maybe go off and work for someone else or or set up their own new business why why do you want this to happen through passing down a more profitable version of your business

*Well I mean this is this is why I started the business in the first place you know was to was to be able to pass on something to them you know obviously as you can tell I'm not in the best of health and you know I'm I'm wanting to uh you know make sure that they are set up in a in a way way that uh you know if I'm no longer around that they are going to be able to you know be very doing very well for themselves you know it took me uh you know 20 years to get to this point and I want to just give them a head started life*

It took you 20 years to get the business to $150,000 a year

*Well no I mean I have the construction company that does about two and a half million a year the gutters we just started doing like six months ago*

Oh okay so this is a completely separate company is that what you're saying

*Yeah yeah so one company will go to one son the other company will go to the other son*

Why why not just give both sons a million from the one business and just you know seem seems like this one you know 150,000 6 months in you know why why not just give them the $2 million business and say hey guys here's a million each

*Yeah you know I'm glad you said that because I did ask something similar to that I was like well have you just considered like selling the business and just giving them the money you know or I was like well one's doing 150,000 one's doing 2.5 do you like one over the other you know it was kind of a funny and you kind of reacted the same way I did so that's good to know uh no I'm sorry I got sid track there go ahead and ask the question again*

Yeah so I mean what I'm not clear on is why don't you just either give the two sons you have 50% of the $2 A5 million do year business or Focus your efforts to grow that business more which already has momentum already you know has economies of scale why why not just focus on that

*Yeah I mean that's why I want to get the gutter business up you know to where they're about even you know um you know*

I guess what I'm not clear on though is why not just grow the first company to to 4 million then or 5 million because it's already got legs

*That's a good question I wish I would have asked more um but I didn't so um well I just don't want them to have to squabble or fight over you know 50% ownership and you know in one business you know if they both had 50% ownership or something I don't know I'm making this shit up right now Josh*

Yeah I think that's probably where the conversation would have started to get into what's really going on because it sounds like for most of what we did there we're we're following the the line of what was actually going on on the call at that point if the guy is saying he's got a 2.5 million business and he now wants to grow this gutter one my intuition having been a closer for a long time is there might be something going on with the $2.5 million business like it it's some maybe going to crumble for some reason like yeah maybe I'm wrong but in what reality does someone have a 2.5 million a year business and go you know what let's just start a brand new business instead of just scaling the other one even if the best case scenario is the guy turned around and said Jeremy we've had that business for 20 years we got to 2.5 million after two years and for 18 years we've tried everything to make it grow it it just won't fucking grow now we've closed that objection okay so you you so what I'm wondering then Jeremy is when did you get to the point of realizing we've tried everything this isn't growing the only way I can give my sons uh more so that they don't just get by and they don't struggle is I have to set up a new business when did you come to that point

*Oh as I said Jeremy six months ago we opened the gutter business*

Okay what happened 6 months ago

*Well me and my son sat down and and you know they had a heart to- heart with me and said said listen dad you know we've been trying to grow this construction business and we've put in money we've put in Time Blood Sweat tears it just isn't growing maybe we should just try something new*

Okay great the another objection that I need to cover is how did you grow the construction business to 2.5 million in other words why not just do what you'd figured out on your own with the construction business because imagine a reality where he turns around and says oh dude we just did signs I'd be like well sounds like that worked pretty well for the construction business I don't think you need me and then he has to come back into my frame and sell himself on no Jeremy because signs are completely fucking different in the gutter business oh really why is that well because of blah blah blah blah blah he's going to have to sell himself on why he can't do what he did for the construction business with the gutter business another way I can attack that is um what were you doing in terms of outside help 6 months into the construction business

*Oh Jeremy six months in we we' set everything up and I hired a sales specialist or whatever*

Oh okay cool so you're just repeating the process that works so well for you my next question then why me now now we've covered all of those different angles of objections does that make sense

# Executive Job Coaching

Based on the sources, here are the questions asked by Josh:

* what are you missing as far as data  
* do you think that's the only thing that she's got as her list of comparability as in oh so long as it's to manage a role with 20 people that that will do  
* no why not  
* because well I I I guess I don't know that yet don't know what i just I don't know why i don't know why not of or or in my own opinion why not  
* does that make sense  
* what is she not currently finding with the roles then  
* you know how's that process going for her  
* how much time she putting in how much effort what are the results we know they're not uh good results as far as the end goal but where is it where's the ball being dropped in her application process  
* is there a specific reason why  
* and what would that higher salary do for you in your personal life  
* Could I would it be appropriate to move back even if for example I question they're going into the future and then I just kind of bring it back when it  
* does that make sense  
* what else are you looking for that's comparable to what you had before  
* And then now she's having to tell herself "Well you know what i'm getting jobs that are $80,000 salary or jobs where I'm not running a team." And when she's telling you the experience of what she's currently seeing as available applications she's feeling the pain of how shit her current options are so one thing is these are the things that she wants and and that's good because you need that data but more importantly to make her feel the pain is what are you currently getting as far as opportunities and she'll just give you a list of everything that sucks and when she tells you that she feels that frustration okay so you you are the best place to start would be go back to comparable okay and summarize from there we've got managing teams of 20 people and the salary and I I personally think there's still more in there as far as comparable and then you want to get into what she's currently you know how's it currently going  
* what else when you say comparable do you mean also the the environment like the place I was last at  
* so when it comes to your current search what are you getting as far as available opportunities before you go there why is she worried  
* and you want to choose who you're hiring but you're worried so why exactly are you worried  
* when you say past experiences is this the time that you looked for a role before this or what exactly do you mean by past experiences  
* Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa cuz we can bury her in this so ba let me run you through what she's saying and I'll translate it for you to sales speak so in the past she went to apply for some jobs and she felt like she had more flexibility but despite that she ended up in some roles where the environment she really didn't enjoy it so let's think about what we're selling her we're selling her the fact that in the past with more flexibility she still ended up in a job that she really didn't like the environment now she's in a situation with less flexibility in other words what's the likelihood that she ends up back in that situation in a bad work environment or worse pretty high she doesn't want to go through that experience so what we're going to be selling her at least what we've got so far is by having a a higher level of of executive coaching help she'll have more flexibility which prevents her having to go through that experience of having a bad work environment now we have to get her to relive a bit of that experience to make her really bought in to fuck no I don't want to have that experience again so I would dig into that one or two extra questions so I'd say something like "Okay so in the past you had more flexibility but you actually still ended up in an environment which you you really didn't enjoy despite the money being in an environment where you really didn't enjoy it regardless of the money how did that make you feel having to work in that environment right and then she's going to have to tell the story and when she tells the story then as we get later on in the sales call what we're selling her is not having to relive that bad experience again by choosing a a job role from limited flexibility but she's not going to feel the call it consequence of that if we haven't dug into how bad that experience was so every time you're listening you you got to be listening for what is going to help me sell the prospect where is her pain whether it's in the present or recent past dig into those things because those things help you sell her at the end of the call does that make sense  
* yes that that makes sense and I think often times I'll I'll ask one question but then there's just so much deeper that that I could go many more yep  
* so in the past you had more flexibility but then still ended up in an environment that you did not enjoy regardless of the money that you were making how did that make you feel  
* what was an what was an example of something toxic in that work environment Am I answering that  
* is that accurate  
* And now with the lack of flexibility that you're seeing in the market what exactly do you mean by that you know what have you been seeing as far as opportunities that are out there sorry before you answer that Faith one thing to be aware of guys as far as what we're doing with data gathering is as we go from our opening question through our other questions we pick up something that's going on in the prospect's life but when we first pick it up it's very vague toxic environment well the fuck does that mean toxic environment as we then ask our further questions we are translating that lowresolution vague term into something more specific and as we go from low resolution to high res resolution or low clarity to high clarity we want to finish every time we summarize with the highest level of clarity that we've actually got so let me give you two examples after Faith said the thing about toxic environment not being trusted blah blah blah if you summarize that as saying "Okay so next time when you get in a role you don't want to be in a toxic environment." How does Faith feel when you give that summary it doesn't really make her feel anything cuz it's very low resolution instead you take the higher level of clarity information that you've gathered and you always use that in your conversation so I would have said "Got it." So in your next role you don't want to be in a toxic environment where your decisions are not trusted and you make a decision and then someone just goes back on it now when I'm using the more detailed response she's actually having to refill that feeling of that experience it's like if at the end of the call when we do our big summary we used phrases like "Okay got it so you know the big reason you want executive coaching is you don't want to be in a toxic work environment." it doesn't real ly mean anything to her because it's so vague it's so unspecific you want to take all of the detail you've got and put it into the summary so I would say so you don't want to be in a toxic environment where you're not trusted it's the not being trusted and making a decision and having someone revoke it that bothers her but so what you got to understand as you're going through the discovery is you gather the extra details of questions that gets more clarity and more clarity and more clarity don't waste your time gathering that detail and then go back up to a lowresolution response and just summarize it as low resolution does that make sense  
* Hold on let me take that back let me take that back so you don't want to be in an environment moving forward where you're not trusted and where your choices aren't being questioned is that correct  
* And as far as what you are seeing in terms of the flexibility of the market what has your strategy looked like up until this point  
* I'm getting stuck i'm getting stuck  
* Okay got it Faith so you you want to be in a role where you're not being questioned you mentioned uh in your previous role it was a team of 20 people that you're managing what do you want now as far as your ideal role regarding team or size of team things like that  
* is that correct  
* what are you currently seeing as far as the roles that you think you could secure with the level of flexibility you have right now in terms of your current job search  
* does that make sense guys  
* is that correct  
* yeah Now what are you seeing in terms of your current job search with the opportunities out there  
* so with the listings where you do see that it lines up but there's just an oversaturation of applicants are you receiving any feedback as to why the interviews do not come in or is it primarily generic responses  
* got it now how long have you been looking  
* wow okay so you've been looking for six months and in those six months just to clarify you have not had one interview  
* got it so what I'm understanding is it's been six months in terms of the interviews that you've gotten it's for roles that are offering less and you've gotten no interviews for roles where you would be progressing forward now how is that making you feel  
* appreciate you sharing that with me now that you're diving into your savings i mean how long do we really have here before you need to be in your new role  
* so you definitely cannot go another six months like this you've got 50k left in liquid savings and you're not seeing the opportunity you're not seeing the proper responses for the opportunity that you're looking to gain i mean how much longer are you willing to remain in that position  
* so the question you're missing is so you're seeing all of these applications where there's hundreds of applications and it sounds like you don't feel that getting one of those jobs where you're not questioned you make more money you've got new experiences challenge progressing sounds like you don't think those jobs as far as securing one of those is a possibility for you right now is that accurate  
* why do you think those roles are not possible for you right now  
* okay why does that matter  
* why does that matter for you not being able to get the role  
* okay so you feel that the current level of experience that you're demonstrating in your application is less than a lot of the other competitors  
* yeah based on you know the my resume and how many years I've been at my past companies I'm sure it doesn't compare okay so do you think there's a possibility for you to be able to secure one of these roles with a better resume  
* does that make sense  
* so o over the six months that you've been applying and you thought it was going to be three months have you worked with any professional to curate your resume in a way where the level of experience you have and the other variables actually puts you at a competitive advantage  
* okay and where are you at now as far as wanting to continue trying things on your own  
* Okay so you have kind of two options then in order to kind of move forward one would be well move forward or or make a change one would be go and get a job just any job or option two would be to work with a professional that actually all day long all they do is work with people that feel like they're in a weak position as far as application for a job and put them in a place where they actually have the strongest or one of the strongest applications given that those are kind of your two options now which one of those are you leaning more towards  
* okay and if you did watch this Valentina if you did take a job and it was just one of the normal jobs what level of salary do you feel confident you could get if you just went and took a normal job  
* how much of a pay cut would that be compared to if you did land one of these ideal roles  
* okay and just out of curiosity let's say you went back into just a normal role how would you get out of just that normal role and get into your ideal role  
* how long ago was it when you were applying for your jobs previously when you think things were less competitive  
* okay so four years ago so the difference in salary would be somewhere between 50 and $100,000 and it would potentially be four years of you just staying in a normal role until maybe things become easier for you to get out of that role and get into a a role that you really want so 50,000 100,000 will round it in the middle at 75,000 so it sounds like and correct me if you disagree with the maths here that not giving this a true shot at getting one of these good roles working with a professional could basically cost you $300,000 over the next four years  
* who here would have known how to do that because whatever Valentine's offer is let's say it's 10K we've now said it's a 10K investment for a shot not a guarantee but a shot at you being able to make $300,000 more and I just took her own data what is the job that you think you could get 100,000 what is the job you'd like 150 to 200 and then I said okay well how would you get out of that job and I just took her response well I would just have to wait okay how long and she probably would have said I don't know so I just jumped the gun and said how long ago was it when you think the job market was easier in other words how long does she think the cycles are 4 years okay well 75,000\* 4 300,000 so now you've price anchored your offer as very very very small compared to what it would cost her to not give this a go and to just make the decision to go back to a normal job does that make sense  
* and let's just say at the end of the call she says "Oh 10,000 you know it's a lot of money." You say "Yeah it's a significant investment if you don't want to do it are you telling me that you're perfectly fine guaranteeing that you lose an extra $300,000 over the next four years?"  
* would I guess where I struggle is kind of what would be the next part of the discovery now would would it be time to move into kind of you know what stood out about us or like why us  
* I mean how much of it has she spent For someone that's got 50,000 in savings unless her expenses are like 10 grand 10 grand a month which means she's only got 5 months I don't think the main pain is going to be the fact that she's burning through the money she's got 50 grand she's probably spending three grand a month it it sounds like wow that's you know it's still only 15 months but it's not a burning problem it's not a today problem so why does she want to actually get executive coaching help right now what is actually bothering her we haven't really got into that that pain that will get you to the why now  
* why are you laughing  
* why what is that off  
* are you in the US now Faith are you  
* do I have an accent i didn't really hear you had an American accent  
* could I ask in how long like in how long do you need to or when is your ideal timeline for being in your new role and then when she tells me asking why  
* okay right so you've been looking for six months and you're really only seeing roles where it's lower paying or the roles that you do want to be in you're not receiving interviews for uh for those roles how much longer are you looking to be in that position and or let me take that back how much longer are you looking to do this on your own  
* okay got it so you've been you've been thinking this was going to take you 3 months we're now or don't say we you're now 6 month 6 months in and all of the roles that you're seeing available to you you think are going to be roles where you make less money you don't have new experiences you don't get challenged you're not progressing potentially you're in a toxic environment where you're being questioned and so what I'm curious about Faith is knowing that that's you know your current situation and and the reality is you would just have to go back and take a normal job why now are you reaching out for executive coaching  
* okay when you say you're putting in so much work and it's not working how much I guess we could say how many hours in the last week have you put into applying for roles  
* are you applying for them  
* okay what's the response  
* how many of those nos have you got from the roles that you want in the last 30 days  
* h how many have you applied for in the last 30 days  
* Is that how many you're seeing th at you like what I'm trying to understand is you're only seeing 10 roles you like a month or or are you seeing 20 or 30 but 20 of them you just don't even bother applying for because you think you don't have a shot  
* Okay let me just ask Valentina a question for the offer if someone is seeing a very low volume of roles is there anything that your team the fulfillment team does to actually increase the amount of available options they're seeing  
* does that make sense  
* does that make sense Valentina  
* plus I would want to know what does she think is going on with all of the ones that she applied for that she didn't get a response from  
* got it sense and then we're starting to get the data on okay you're working 40 hours you're not seeing a very high number of opportunities you're only seeing 10 in 30 days which is two a week basically two and a half a week you're applying for you know all the ones that you do see but sorry you're applying for some of the ones you do see not getting a response or or getting a no a lot of the ones that you do see you're not applying for because you just know that your resume is not going to be successful and now we can get into commitment which is so you've you've spent basically 40 hours per week times six months which is times 24 so 40 \* 24 24 48 90 so you've spent 960 hours applying for roles and how much money have you spent  
* okay got it so you spent 960 hours you've dug in to $15,000 of your savings there's an opportunity cost of $300,000 over the next four years is if you don't figure this out have you gotten to the point where you're done trying to figure this out on your own  
* does that make sense Valentina whereas if you try and ask the why now before you've got like as the as the underground mentor says multiple legs to the chair you'll just burn that question that question just won't land for you  
* you'll get you'll get that response from a nice prospect but I don't think they mean it they're just telling you what you want to hear okay got it so you've been you've been thinking this was going to take you 3 months we're now or don't say we you're now 6 month 6 months in and all of the roles that you're seeing available to you you think are going to be roles where you make less money you don't have new experiences you don't get challenged you're not progressing potentially you're in a toxic environment where you're being questioned and so what I'm curious about Faith is knowing that that's you know your current situation and and the reality is you would just have to go back and take a normal job why now are you reaching out for executive coaching  
* how much I guess we could say how many hours in the last week have you put into applying for roles  
* are you applying for them okay what's the response  
* how many of those nos have you got from the roles that you want in the last 30 days  
* how many have you applied for in the last 30 days  
* Is that how many you're seeing that you like what I'm trying to understand is you're only seeing 10 roles you like a month or or are you seeing 20 or 30 but 20 of them you just don't even bother applying for because you think you don't have a shot  
* is that clear to you as far as the reason you're in this situation and will continue to be in this situation is up until recently you were kind of just excusing it as the market and you haven't done anything outstanding to stand out is that fair to say  
* are you at the point now when you're no longer going to blame the market and you're also at the point where you're going to actually do something extraordinary to be able to stand out from the crowd  
* why now  
* does that make sense Valentina  
* well yeah so so Faith you're telling me that you spend you know 40 hours a week now for 6 months which is 960 hours of applying you've dug into 15K of your savings leaving you with about 50k in liquid savings left and there's an opportunity harold be careful how you phrase things you've spent 15k so you have $35,000 left doesn't doesn't sound doesn't sound very painful and you you do need to keep a calculator on your desk which is funny but it would be better to say 15 out of 50 so it'd be better to say you've you've spent $15,000 of your savings so you've already gone through 30% of your entire savings don't say you've got $35,000 left because then she's like "Oh things are fine i've got I got 35k left not a big deal."  
* well and I thought it was 15K had left her now with 50K left but still that's that's not a little amount so okay got it let me In my head it was going to be like 50k down 50k left but Josh just made up that my expenses were only 3K so in my head it was going to be like six months i've already gone through 50k and I only have six months left before I run into the next 50k oh I'm okay i missed the day so you had a 100k well I don't think we never No one ever Yeah I don't think we ever like I don't think that question was ever asked until you kind of just just made up that number then I tried to say like my expenses are more like 7k a month  
* how many interviews have you received for the roles that would make sense for you taking a step up it wouldn't it wouldn't sound right if you did that at I I I know I just did it but I was just explaining that we would have needed to have had that piece of data i should have been clear on that it would sound really salesy if you tried to say that it sounds like you're trying to intentionally bury them in the pain we would have had to have got that data before and you would say so you spent 960 hours you've had not a single interview you've spent 30% of your savings blah blah blah blah blah you can't ask the question in the middle of the the summary but I I demonstrated that badly so just assume you have that data already  
* okay so and and how many so then would I ask the question of how many interviews just to kind of let's just imagine you've already asked it before and we've you got that data and just imagine the answer is zero now when you're summarizing you're layering everything together it's like if someone has spent 30% of their savings could be bad could be not that bad depends how many interviews if somebody has spent 30% of their savings and they've had some interviews no interviews could be bad depends how much time and effort they've put in in other words every time you have a piece of data and whether it's a good or a bad situation for the prospect the answer could be it depends you need to know what it depends on and get that data as well so there's no more it depends in other words unequivocally the prospect situation is dog shit there can't be any room for interpretation like well to be honest Faith you spent 30% of your income you know and you haven't had any interviews but you've only spent 10 minutes a week doing this then the prospect could kind of rationalize at the end of the call it's not that bad because it's not that bad because I didn't put in time it's not that bad because I haven't spent any of my money or it's not that bad because whatever the other one was I can't remember so you need to get all the data from every different direction so that there's just no questioning that she's in a bad situation does that make sense  
* yes that makes sense and then would it be appropriate here to ask uh yeah like how much longer are you willing to be in a position where this is happening and kind of get into detail there again or are you willing to go six more months spending 960 hours would would it make sense to ask that question now that I've gathered that data  
* okay so you've spent 960 hours 30% of your income you haven't had a single interview you know you're going to have to go back to a job which would lose you $300,000 over the next four months i'm curious you're you're reaching out now for executive coaching why now what was the turning point on you know bang- on day whatever it would be you know five five months 3 weeks and six days what has changed  
* okay yeah and so you've gone through 30% of your savings and there's an opportunity cost of $300,000 so you're reaching out now for executive coaching out of curiosity what's changed you know why are you reaching out today  
* got it now when did you get to a place where you realize that the results would no longer where the results would not be different from this point moving forward i would like  
* It's a great question i wouldn't say when but you're asking the right question cuz the question that you're asking is I still don't understand Faith why today all of a sudden you've now come to this epiphany that the results aren't going to change so you're asking the right question but I wouldn't say when cuz when is like well it was 2 and a half days ago or two weeks ago i'd say okay why have you now realized having been trying this for 6 months that nothing's going to change unless you have outside help with your application  
* okay yeah it's why have you now realized that  
* why yeah so what has led to that realization is a is a slightly more calibrated way to ask the question  
* okay so you've been trying this for 6 months you now realize if nothing changes nothing changes what led to that sudden realization or that moment of clarity  
* What shifted you're almost I don't like you're almost saying I don't get it but there's an element of your tonality that's like come on I'm not that stupid you're kind of saying that to the prospect in your vibe a little bit  
* okay got it yeah so you've now realized that the results are not going to change why oh wait no no no i'm trying to decide which question so you're basically saying why after six months of not having a single interview have you now come to the realization that nothing's going to change if nothing changes it's a very direct question but you're asking why like you you you sell me Faith you tell me why something's changed  
* yeah so Faith why now after six months on your own have you realized that nothing's going to change  
* okay so you've realized now that the actions that you've been taking for the last 6 months are not going to get you where you're looking to go  
* right you notice slight difference in the way you're phrasing it  
* and and notice a little thing that you can kind of nudge her with in fact I want to see if I can ask you guys this as a question what is what is one of the objections that the prospect gave that we can now make the prospect face the mirror that that objection is bullshit based on what she just said anybody pick up on what it is  
* why did Faith say that she's not being s well done Jordan and so what has what she just said told herself the prospect it's not the market it's your process because someone else got a job in the same market in the same time as you applying for a job and you didn't get the job the person you know got the job and so if we really really really play like advanced advanced advanced level closing when I said that it was an outside thing that changed the prospect's why now it was that her own belief her own rationalization her own bullshit excuse got deleted when recently someone else in the same market got a job notice how as I've said guys it's inbound sales the prospects already have all the fucking answers going on in their life that you need to close them because it's inbound sales you would be thinking "Oh no Faith has an objection she thinks that it's the market how the fuck do I tell her it's not the market?" You don't tell her it's not the market you keep digging and asking questions and she'll tell herself indirectly that it's not the market now if if the prospect was being difficult or you felt that they weren't really taking ownership you can just tell them straight okay so you've been applying for six months you haven't had a single interview and in 4 months someone else not only must have had interviews but they secured a role so what is your current belief now around the market is too saturated  
* does that make sense Valentina  
* and then what do you think you're doing wrong that meant that you still haven't figured this out and other people have figured it out and and notice a little thing that you can kind of nudge her with in fact I want to see if I can ask you guys this as a question what is what is one of the objections that the prospect gave that we can now make the prospect face the mirror that that objection is bullshit based on what she just said anybody pick up on what it is  
* Why did Faith say that she's not being s  
* So when So when you'd been applying for six months and you still haven't had a single interview and then someone else landed a role within four months how did that make you feel or what did that make you think  
* okay so why hasn't it been possible for you and we're just going to take it round full circle just asking it as a question  
* Go from Yeah so when you've been applying for six months and you know som eone that got a role in four months why do you think that it hasn't worked for you  
* And now that you've realized that your resume isn't standing out and you've been in this position for six months you know how how has that made you feel  
* see if you can do it using the language that Faith gave you  
* okay so now that you've realized that your resume hasn't been strong enough to generate these proper opportunities you're you're using words that she didn't say what was the word  
* Okay so through our questions we've moved the prospect without objection handling guys just okay so you've been doing this six months you spent 960 hours you thought you were doing it your way what changed well someone else did it in four months huh interesting why do you think they did it in four months and you haven't done it in six well I guess they stand out oh interesting so it's not the market it's that you don't stand out so are you at the point now where you're no longer willing to keep spending 960 hours 30% of your income every 6 months to not stand out  
* how much longer are you willing to spend 30% of your savings 960 hours every 6 months to not stand out  
* how much longer are you willing to not stand out knowing that it's going to cost you $300,000 over the next four years  
* so the how much longer question when you asked me before Valentina should I use it now it's like no because I don't know what I'm asking her how much longer are you not willing to do  
* why are we the people that you want to help you stand out  
* why now are you committed to standing out  
* does that make sense Valentina  
* how much longer are you willing to not stand out  
* is that fair to say Faith  
* anything that you want to add she says no and then you just summarize not because this is the key guys how much longer do you want to pay $233 a day don't say that because that is not including ownership or responsibility that result is as a as an output is not her choice what is her choice is the input which leads to the output so how much longer are you willing to not stand out because when you phrase that to the prospect they're like "Oh that's my fault that's my choice." If you just say this they're just like "Okay well you're just trying to bury me in pain Mr closer mrs closer." And they won't like you they'll feel like you're trying to sell them you have to get this and you have to get this which going back to what I've always said guys find all the data on the pain and the consequences and then get clear on why it's happening and make sure that they're clear and admit why it's happening find those two things connect them in the middle and then ask them how much longer are they willing to do this does that make sense to everyone alex you your head has exploded i don't know which Alex it is as well because there's two Alex's with the same color and just first name so I'm not sure which Alex it is anyway Faith sorry I cut you off did you have anything else you wanted to add  
* Is there any specific picture that you consciously avoid looking at where is that picture how do you look in that picture when was the last time you looked at it how many times in the last week have you walked past it and consciously not looked at it knowing that you're walking past it consciously and not looking at it you're obviously aware that that picture is on the mantle piece how do you feel every time in the last week 17 times when you've walked past that not looking at it why do you feel that way  
* am I getting it to a point in the discovery where I'm like if this person doesn't sign up like they're the wiring in their brain is incorrect like if I cannot say that then I'm I'm doing something wrong if that makes sense  
* anything else  
* all right valentina did you have anything you wanted to add  
* Do you still think that  
* And if she says yes you say "So if you think it's the market how are you going to solve that?"  
* was there any other reason you turned up to this call  
* oh interesting how much of it do you think is the market versus the fact that your CV is weak  
* is 50/50 enough for you to make an investment in outside help so that you can have the best shot possible at doing this  
* why whatever the prospect says I can make them sell themselves whatever they fucking tell me because I'm just going to take them around in circles on my curiosity with complete detachment doesn't matter what they tell me oh yeah i think it's the market okay cool why on the call  
* Does that make sense  
* yeah 100% just makes you makes you realize like when you're studying like don't just focus on if this is like the one path to go just know it's another avenue  
* does that make sense  
* great stuff Harrison do you have anything else you want to add  
* does anybody else want to come up does anybody else have anything they want to add alex there we go all righty the question is which  
* Do any of you have anything you want to come up and add if not that's no worries i will do a summary myself i'll do all the work for you i'm just kidding and we'll bounce all right Harrison there we go all right brother what have you got how's it going oh new background i like it  
* even if you get into the behavior even if you if you can't identify it and let me know if I'm if I'm understanding this right having them understand the output as well it's not like you just skip the skip the outputs and go straight to the inputs you still need both is that right  
* Can I go to the gym when I'm tired  
* does that make sense  
* do you think the people that did stand out do you think they did something to stand out that was above and beyond just trying things on their own  
* so you know when I kind of summarize those two things is that clear to you as far as the reason you're in this situation and will continue to be in this situation is up until recently you were kind of just excusing it as the market and you haven't done anything outstanding to stand out is that fair to say  
* are you at the point now when you're no longer going to blame the market and you're also at the point where you're going to actually do something extraordinary to be able to stand out from the crowd  
* why now

# Rationale\_Tie-Down

Okay straight for it **do you still feel like what you're doing is the ultimate solution to all of these issues**

*yeah I think I think a cellular detoxification is is the way to go yeah*

**got it and do you feel that what you're doing on your own is going to ultimately fix all of the problems that you have if you just see it through on your own**

*it's possible yeah it's possible that with with enough time and research and you know digging around for the right information then it's possible that I can I can get the healing I need on my own yeah*

**got it if you were to ballpark it how much time do you think it's going to take you to heal everything if you continue this on your own**

*from the research I've done I I think it would be somewhere around 2 years*

**okay got it and how much extra time and effort do you think you would have to put in over those two years continuing to do your own research**

*i think it would it would be like what it's been like the last month which is like I'm every pretty much every free hour I have outside of my running my business I'm putting towards like reading and watching videos so it's adding up to like four or five hours a day right now*

**got it so four or five hours a day 2 years let me just calculate that 365 \* 2 \* 4 so 2,920 hours okay so what I'm curious about then is do you want to spend another two years and 2,920 hours of your own time to fix this on your own or would you rather invest some of your own money to speed up the process and to buy back all of that time and potentially to actually do things in a better way because of all of the expertise of Dr pompa which of those would you prefer to do**

*yeah I I would prefer to work with someone like Dr pompa which is why I'm on the call you know I I know I could probably figure it out on my own but I don't I don't really believe in that like even with my training I've invested into you know coaches and people to help me improve my physique in a faster period of time*

**Okay you mentioned you don't really believe in that what don't you believe in**

*i don't believe in like having to do it all on my own like figuring it all out on my own okay*

**so how long have you been trying to figure it out on your own**

*well six months ago when like this issue became really serious I was reaching out to my like you know normal doctor that I that I have and that's when I started getting the blood work done so like even when this first started I was reaching out to doctors and you know trying to figure out what was going on okay*

**so you've kind of been doing a bit on your own but a bit with whatever doctors you could find is that a fair assessment**

*correct yeah i I had not found a doctor yet that I felt like really understood what my issue was so okay i had I felt like I had to take matters into my own hands to some degree*

**got it h how do you feel comparatively with the level of understanding of your real issues that Dr pompa has compared to all of these doctors that you've tried in the past**

*well when I first saw his content it was like it felt like wo this was like the doctor I've been looking for like someone who actually understands what I'm dealing with and has experience dealing with this across like a a large number of people not just like a one-off random case but like multip it seemed like he had worked with maybe hundreds of people who had been dealing with some sort of like you know cellular issue autoimmune issue and so yeah I was really excited when I saw his stuff*

**okay you mentioned there you know this feels like the doctor you've been looking for i'm I'm curious given the conversation that we've had and how much you've got going on as far as the business the bodybuilding the mental clarity the skin your family how how do you feel thinking that you may have found the doctor that you've been looking for**

*I felt I feel relief for the first time in a while okay yeah okay like I feel like I'll be able to enjoy my life again uh-huh*

**okay so I'm curious then how much longer do you want to have that potential for relief as opposed to actually starting to get that relief**

*well I I don't not not much longer*

**Is there any Is there anything else that we need to cover as far as why you need to do this why you haven't been able to solve it in the past because you haven't had doctors that truly understood your issue on a cellular level is there anything else that we need to understand as far as you preferring to make an investment to save your own time and to save your own effort and potentially to save potentially wasting time not truly getting to the root cause of the issue is there anything else that we haven't covered as far as moving forward today**

*no I think I think you're very clear on my issue and the direction I've been moving in and it's led me here to Dr pmpa and I feel very confident that his his experience and his understanding of health is where I need to where I need to be okay*

Based on the sources provided and our conversation history, Dr. Robin is playing the salesperson (closer) and Chris is playing the prospect. Josh Lyons is coaching throughout the roleplay.

The transcript segment below features the dialogue between Dr. Robin as the salesperson and Chris as the prospect, focusing on the latter part of the discovery conversation which likely falls within the approximate 38-49 minute timeframe you specified. This section includes questioning around the severity of the current situation, the ticking timer, and the impact on Chris's dream of competing.

Okay so that's if you get it fixed with where you're at right now with the pain stopping your workouts halfway through having done that three times in the last two months are you going to be able to get stage ready and win

*i don't know if you froze no I I I don't think I I'd be able to*

**why not**

*because I can't train at the level I need to to be stage ready without this back pain being fixed*

**And so how much longer are you willing to continue going to train knowing that the training you're doing is never going to get you to a place where you can step on stage and win knowing that you're on a ticking timer of never being able to fulfill your dream**

*Not much longer that's why I'm on this call*

okay where you can come back in a week if you want

*no I I want to get this fixed now*

was there something that shifted as far as not being able to finish the workouts knowing that you're on a ticking timer that meant that you contacted us and you decided that you need to get this resolved what What happened

*i think after my last workout and having to only getting through halfway through it I just had enough with the back pain and I I want to get this solved so I can compete at the level*

okay that that makes sense that you had to stop the workout what I'm curious about is h how in your mind did that connect with the the dream that you're not fulfilling knowing that you're on a limited time to fulfill it was there I don't know like you you saw a friend of yours that just posted photos on his Facebook that he just won a bodybuilding show and you're like that that needs to be me like was there something that you saw recently or had an experience recently that just not being able to finish your workouts became no I'm not I'm not willing to lose my dream did you have any shifting experience like that recently

*it's just the fact that the the next show is in October and I saw and you know as as weeks go by and I'm getting closer to that date that it's not going to be possible unless I get this fixed now*

okay okay and and was there something you saw as far as the show coming up that you were like "Okay if I don't get this fixed now that show date is going to come and go and it's not going to be possible." Like did did you have like some moment of clarity over that that timeline recently

*i would just say you know I came into this year and when I when I wrote my my goals down it was I I really wanted to do this and now that I see you know I see I pass the poster every day at every time I'm at the gym just I know I'm getting closer and closer so I I know that I need to get this fixed now or it's not going to happen*

so what I'm curious about is if I'm understanding correctly you've passed that poster at the gym every day since you wrote down your goals in January 1 is that correct

*correct yeah*

so so you've probably passed that poster what are we April January March you know 12 12 weeks three times a week you you've probably passed that poster 50 times what shifted that the last time you passed the poster something clicked inside of you that this needs to be fixed what actually has changed

*i think it was just the level of pain that I had on my last session which really triggered I need to get this fixed or it's just going to keep getting worse and then I'll never be able to do this*

okay what was it about the level of pain that triggered that compared to the level of pain you were in previously

*it was much sharper i felt like I couldn't you even sometimes walking was hard so it's definitely a different level versus the other few times that it did happen*

okay so so you're saying you you you had workouts before you're in pain you you did have to stop your workouts but if I'm understanding correctly and I don't want to put words in your mouth it sounds like previously once you stopped the workout to a certain extent you kind of forgot about it you forgot that you had to stop the workout whereas this time you stopped the workout and then you were still in pain literally just walking that you're like "Shit this has got to the point now where I can't even walk without being in pain what does that mean for my dream of being a competitive bodybuilder is that Am I understanding that correctly

*yeah that's exactly it it was a big wakeup call to be honest*

# Dating

**what's the biggest challenge in your love life right now**?

*Yeah I feel like the biggest challenge is I am like going on dates it's not hard to like find someone to go out with but I just once I go out with someone I if it does turn into something either I don't like them or if it does turn into something it's just not lasting that long*

**you're investing your own own time going on dates with the wrong guys that isn't going anywhere**? 

so **you're going on dates with the wrong guys and going on dates with guys that doesn't go anywhere**

**it sounds like you're going on dates with guys you don't like and those dates are not going anywhere**?

 **you're going on dates to the wrong guys and going on dates to guys that doesn't go anywhere** and she's like oh shit yeah that sounds bad and it sounds bad because it's the facts yeah all right go again absolutely okay so sounds like **you're going on dates with the wrong guys and guys where it's not going anywhere**?

*Yeah*

so **how many dates have you been on in the last week**?

so **you had four meetups in the last seven days that were with the wrong guys that wasn't going to go anywhere**? 

**how much time did you spend on those dates**? oh wow so **you spent six hours total on in the last s days right** 

just **two random Meats random versus organic** 

 **these were just random meetups with guys who happen to approach you**? 

 so **it sounds like these were random you know meetups with guys who had approach you do you have second dates planned with either of those guys**?

*I only have a second date planned with one of them*

Okay **why is that**?

*Well I only had two dates this past weekend the one I it was terrible I didn't like him at all the other one was was better so I I figured I'll just set up a second date with the one that was better*

**it doesn't sound like he's really what you're looking for is that accurate**?

*Yeah that's accurate*

So **why are you even investing committing to a second date**? 

**you don't want to continue rationalizing going on dates with better than the worst date you've ever been on**?

*Yes*

**Why**? 

 **this one guy was better or you guess he's better is he really the type of person that you're looking for longterm**?

*Probably not I just don't have any plans this upcoming weekends so I figured why not*

**Are you looking for something shortterm or are you looking for something longterm**? 

 **why are you continuing to engage in a behavior that does the complete opposite of what you're looking for**?

*Well to be honest Ian because I I don't have any other options*

Okay **I'm curious then how many times over the last 6 months have you engaged in a behavior that's completely the opposite of what you're looking for**?

*Oh it's hundreds*

**How many hours do you think you've spent doing that**?

*Oh thousands of hours*

**How do you feel investing a thousand hours of your time into something that is taking you in completely the wrong direction to your dating goals**?

*Honestly I feel shit*

**Why do you feel shit about that**?

*Well I you know I'm 45 and I want kids soon so*

Let me ask you Faith **have you gotten to the point where you're done taking shortterm oh well this is something's better than nothing it's not what I'm looking for but you know I don't have any other options have you gotten to the point when you're done going down that path and you now need to commit to going after what you truly want which is something longterm**?

*Yes*

**Why**? 

 **what what would your next question be**? well **what are you looking for**? 

 **are you at the point now where your wanting for longterm is enough that you're willing to stop the behavior of wasting your time on something shortterm that's not compatible or do you want to continue doing that behavior**?

*No honestly now I'm done*

**Why what changed what was the turning point**?

*Oh you know the last date*

**What happened on the last day**?

*Honestly I was sat there with this guy realizing I'm running this pattern I've been running it for 6 months 12 months 18 months whatever*

Okay that makes sense but **what actually changed**? 

 **when when are we going to have a little grandchild**? 

 **what was the issue when your grandma said that**?

*Well honestly she said it to me but I realized that I'm actually living in congruently with what I want in life*

**How much longer you going to live in congruently are you done with that behavior** 

 so **are you looking for a short-term relationship**?

*Uh no I I do want a long-term relationship*

Okay and if you're feeling like this guy is not a good fit for that **why have another date with him next weekend**?

*Well I don't know when I'm going to find the right long-term relationship so I like I just felt like it's better than sitting at home on the couch by myself*

Okay **how long have you known you do want a long-term relationship but have been spending time with the wrong guys**? 

 **how long have you been trying to find the right guy**? 

 **you've been trying for three years with what you're currently doing and it hasn't worked so how long do you think it's going to take if ever to find the right guy when you have a track record for three years of your current way of approaching dating not getting you the right guys**? 

 **let me ask you Fai given that it hasn't worked for 3 years are you at the point where you want to continue running a strategy that hasn't worked for 3 years and see if it might just miraculously have a a different outcome to the last three years or do you want a different strategy**? 

 **if it hasn't worked at all not even once for the last 5 years are you going to continue using this rationalization of well you know I'll just keep going on dates with the wrong guys because I don't know when I'm going to find the right guy or are we on this call today because you know that that strategy is absurd and you need to make a change get them to commit**? 

 okay **how long have you been looking for the right guy**?

*I would say about the past five years I'm about to turn 40 so I really focus just like on myself in my career in my late 20s and my early 30s and I built that up but then once I got to a spot where I felt like I was doing good there I I was ready to start looking for a relationship and yeah that was probably around 35*

**how many times have you gone through this cycle of spending time going on dates and entertaining people who you know aren't long-term potential**? 

 **have you come across the right guy at all during those five years**? 

 **how many leads have you got in the last 30 days**? Zero okay **what about in the last 6 months**? zero **how long's it been since you had a lead**? 

 **are you at the point now where you're going to stop your current lead gen strategy and do something different yes why**? 

 **how long have you been £320**? 5 years

 **what what changes of exercise programs have you done over the last years**? 

 **have you ever lost weight**? 

 **what I'm wondering is how much longer you going to follow a strategy that has proven to not work for five years**?

I'm curious **are you done with that why are you done with that what was the turning point**? if we want to get into details when we then future pace which we would probably do on this example we say okay so you've been meeting the wrong guys **have you clarified what would be the right guys so that we have Clarity on getting you out on dates with the right guys what are some of those criteria**? okay blank blank blank but before we even get into hypothetical we need to get into commitment can she see the reality of her situation do you see that Ian?

*Yes I do see that I do see that my thought process behind why I asked that is because with our offer a lot of it is internal work and their approach to the relationship so the reason I ask what happened is because maybe this guy could have actually been the right you know masculine man who is a good partner but she didn't know how to accept that and show up or she did accept somebody who was too feminine and so really just getting that context on like okay well what actually happened you know what's the problem that we're trying to solve here*

okay got it so **what do you think meant that for 5 years you kept attracting the wrong guys and didn't attract the right guys why do you think that happened**? 

 **what needs to change why do you think you had that track record why do you think that's going to this is you know us and what we provide is going to give you a new track record why do you need to make that change now**? 

 well **how long have you been trying to find the right guy**? 5 years 

**what what results have you had**? 

 **are you at the point now where you need to do something different**?

*Yes*

Okay interesting **why do you feel you didn't find the right guys for 5 years**?

*Well because of this this this*

Okay **why do you say those things**?

*Well because of this this this*

Okay okay so **what do you feel you do need to find the right guys**? this this and this okay makes sense **why if you do do you feel like we're the people to give you those things**? well for this reason this reason this reason okay beautiful so **what I'm wondering is you've been running this strategy for 5 years hasn't worked you were doing this wrong you didn't have this right thing was there a turning point when you had this realization of what you were missing but also the time and effort and you know everything else that you were losing because of not making a change**?

*Yes*

**What was that Turning Point moment**? okay it makes total sense so **let me ask you then how much longer are you willing to feel blank blank blank blank blank because you don't have these things you do have these wrong things and therefore you're continuing to run a cycle of spending five years having no results towards your end goal of finding a long-term partner how much longer**? that that's it the Call's done makes sense?

*Makes sense*

Beautiful all right keep going okay so **five years had a couple maybe a few month relationships just haven't found the right guy are you at a point** you downplayed that and rationalized it so for 5 years you had a couple relationships no no no **for five years you didn't have a single person that met your goal be clear to the prospect don't rationalize with them** okay okay so over the last five years **have not found the right partner who did meet your goals are you at the point where** emphasize it it's not for 5 years you haven't found the right partner **for 5 years you haven't found a single man that meets your long-term goals** 

 **how many more days are you going to waste**?

*Not another day*

Well **why not what changed**? 

 so **you have not met a single man who meets your goals over the last five years are you at a point now where you feel like you need to change that**? 

**you have not found a single man who meets your goals over the last five years correct**? 

*Yeah I actually like had to face it because then he just like stopped and like waited till it sank in versus the last time like yeah he did steamroll over it it was like yeah but like before I could even like acknowledge it in my own head he had already moved on*

Okay so you haven't met a single man who meets your goals of a long-term relationship in the last five years?

*Yeah*

Okay **are you at a point now where you feel like you need a change in your approach**?

*Yeah definitely*

Okay **why**? 

 **why**?

*Well it hasn't worked over the last five years and um like I said I am I am turning 40 so I do feel like time's ticking*

Right and I mean I know it was five years ago where this became a priority and time started ticking **what happened 5 years ago that made you realize this is something important for you to get figured out**?

 **what what's ticking right**? 

*Well like I said I'm I'm turning 40 and I spent like I said earlier my 20s most of my 30s working really hard and I I worked so hard for so many years to to get to where I'm at and I did really well for myself and I made a lot of money but I I don't feel like I've really gotten to enjoy life I I haven't taken a week off and gone on vacation I haven't gotten to travel and I feel like at this point I've worked so hard but I haven't gotten to actually enjoy life yet and who knows like I said I'm turning 40 by the time I'm 60 or 70 it might be harder to move around or to travel and I really want to be able to enjoy life while I still can*

**what are you not enjoying about your life right now by not having the right partner**? 

 **what are you not enjoy in what way are you not enjoying life by being single and or going on dates with guys that are not what you're looking for and having casual sex or that's a bit a but having casual relationships on a you know a week by- week basis with guys that something's better than being alone at home right**? 

 so **in what way does not having that partner hold you back from enjoying life right now**?

*Well like I said I really want to be able to travel and enjoy life that way and yeah I could go on a weekl long trip by myself to a really really nice place but I I just think it would be really enjoyable to share those experiences with someone else and I don't really want to spend all that time and money to just go somewhere really nice and just just be lonely there I could just be lonely at home*

so **you mentioned you're lonely at home and you've also now mentioned that whilst you could do what a lot of people do and try and run from that loneliness and take a trip somewhere you've already come to the realization that that isn't going to solve the problem is that accurate**?

*Yes*

**Why**? **Why did you have that realization**? well you know I've thought about it or I went on a trip and it turned out shit because I thought I was going to have a great time **how much did you spend on that trip**? 

so **you've realized you're feeling lonely at home and that if you did travel that you would just be feeling lonely while you travel what brought you to that realization**?

*Yeah I mean I've looked into different trips and different places to go but I think when I picture myself going and being there and then actually getting there like I'm thinking about being there for a week and like at the end of the day I'm still going to be there by myself for a week which just I I don't know what what I going to do by myself sit sit there by myself even if I'm somewhere really nice I'm still going to be by myself*

Okay that makes perfect sense and so if it's not a trip or travel **what do you feel will actually have to change**?

*I'm going to have to find a partner that's right for me first*

**what do you think would need to change to make sure you're not wasting more time going on dates with the wrong guys**? 

o **what do you feel has meant that for the last five years you haven't met the right guy**? 

 **why if you do do you feel like we're the people to get that solved for you**?

All right do it again okay so I mean **what do you feel over the last five years held you back from being able to create that relationship**?

*Yeah like I said it's not it's not going on dates it's just more so I don't know where to find the right guy like I I do find guys it's just I don't know where to look for the right guy*

Okay **what have you been trying to find the right guy**?

*I haven't really been trying I just let people come up to me and if they ask me out and if it seems like it might be a decent fit then I'll I'll go along with it*

so **in what way moving forward do you think you would need to find the right person or would need to adjust to find the right person**? I'm sorry could you ask that again?

*Yeah so excuse me if my question wasn't super clear what do you feel would need to change moving forward in your approach to find the right person?*

*Yeah I just don't know if I'm going to the right spots like I said and you know like if it's someone that asked me out the gym like that hasn't worked out um so I just don't I don't really like I said don't know where to look or where to go where I would be meeting guys that are actually the type of person that I'm looking for*

So the rationalization right now anybody spot it is that she's saying she doesn't know where to look but she hasn't been looking no not quite guys as you go through these role-play trainings the things I'm going to teach you about rationalizations it's it's not going to happen in a number of weeks guys it's also not going to happen in four months but if you're in this Mastermind for 12 months 18 months and you learn all of these ways people rationalize they are abstract meaning doesn't matter whether I'm selling dating crypto Health whatever and when you master all of these rationalizations you it's like seeing the Matrix so let me give it to you and then you'll be like oh the rationalization she's making is like oh well I don't know where to look so I'm just at home the whole time because I don't leave the house to go to where the right honey holes are for guys no no no she doesn't sit at home all day she goes to the gym she goes to work she walks on the street she goes to the grocery shop she goes to all of these different places but she's not meeting the right guys the rationalization was oh well I don't know where to go as if as if she just sits at home all day and therefore doesn't go anywhere well we know that's not true because she's not a Hermit right and I assume Ian for your offer part of your offer is probably like the spiritual side of things as far as like why are they not attracting the right guys and bumping into the right guys when they are out and about is that accurate?

*Yeah exactly*

I don't know where to look okay so **in the last seven days what activities have you done**? well I went to a social event you know I went to the cinema went to the gym interesting **did you bump into any of the right guys in any of those places**?

*No*

**How many hours if you were to Bull Park the number would you say you've been out the house in the last s days**?

*I don't know 20 hours*

So **why do you think for 20 hours outside the house in a range of different environments that I think we could both agree have guys in them why do you think you're not attracting guys and more specifically the right guys**? 

 **do you want to take a second to think about it**? 

 **do you want to spend another five years not thinking about it**? 

 **do you find yourself sitting in one or both of those camps**? 

 **why' you say that**? 

 **you know I appreciate you said yes but I I I get the sense that you're not so sure about that**?

*Yeah no I'm not really sure about that*

Okay **why are you not sure about that**? okay so if it's not that **what do you think it could be**?

 **is this like a boutique gym where there's like you know two women and two guys and you're you know in the gym or is it like a a big gym where there's lots of people**?

*Yeah it's like a big open gym like if if I go and there's probably I don't know 30 to 50 other people in there at the same time*

Okay and if you were to Bull Market you know let's just say there's 50 people **is it 50% men 50% women or is it like you know 90% women and there's basically no guys there**?

*Uh no probably like 75% men 25% women*

Okay and I know physical is not the only thing that we're looking for but it's the first thing of those 75% men at least just physically **do you think some of those guys would be compatible for what you're looking for**?

*Uh at least five of them probably*

Okay and okay so that's five and **is that like five it's the same guy it's the same Five Guys every single week or are you saying with how many members there are in the gym you know every week there's like five options of guys at least just physically that could be you know worthy of a date**?

*Well I I usually go like at the same time every day so it's always like the same people there and I I us see like the same like five decent looking guys*

M makes total sense and then of those five guys I know you haven't probably spoken to them so you don't know but you're a woman and women are very intuitive **do you look at them physically and think they're physically attractive but they're probably like there's there's nothing else really going on or do you look at them and think you know what that could potentially be a guy that could be worth going on dates with**?

*Yeah out of the five I would say like maybe one or two that could have potential*

Okay beautiful so that's there uh and then **what about this work dinner how how many people were at the work event as far as in your group**?

*Um well it was a it was like a big event like there was probably 100 people from the community there and then like who I was with I sat at a table with like maybe 10 people*

Okay and **ratio of guys to girls at your table and at the event**?

*I would say like an even mix okay 5050*

Um and then you mentioned going to the groceries going to the gas station stuff like that **do do you ever come across guys that you see at the groceries or at the gas station that you think you know what maybe if if I actually had figured this side of my life out that could have turned into some compatible dates**?

*Probably not at the gas station but okay at the grocery store at the groceries*

Okay awesome so even in the last week you know there's been one or two guys at the gym there's been 50 guys I know they're not all compatible but there's been 50 guys at the work dinner you go to the groceries every week **is that a typical week for you or sometimes you do more activities or or leave the house more often where you bump into males**?

*Yeah I would say like that's the average week like Monday through Friday but there are weekends where maybe like I'll go out for lunch or dinner or like I you know went shopping or something to the mall once a month like there's times where it could be more*

Okay got it so you go to the mall as well that you know bumps up your options so what I'm wondering is **do you think you're not going to the right places or not being in the right place at the right time and that's the issue or do you think there's something deeper here that is you are coming across guys but for some reason it's not turning into an interaction**?

*I felt like I wasn't going to the right place in my mind I was thinking like I would need to go to a place where there's like a a bunch of my type and like I get to pick from there but since you phrased it that way yeah I'm sure like I've I've had to come across someone that's my type and I don't know maybe just not realized it or maybe just not actually interacted with them*

Okay so maybe realizing it and then also either you not interacting or them you know the right guy not interacting with you and then there's a part of you that you know which is completely accurate that there could be some improvements to where you go that might have a a better array of compatible guys so it's kind of a bit of both you know one problem is that there could be some places that you're not going to cuz you know you don't know what you don't know but also the places that are within your schedule and have been within your schedule for 5 years you might not be realizing that you're coming across the right guys or they're not interacting with you you're not interacting with them **is that accurate**?

*Yeah*

Okay so you see what I'm doing there I'm getting the details and even just by clarifying roughly how many people in the gym the worked dinner the groceries Faith's now like actually maybe my rationalization isn't quite as grounded as I thought it was that make sense yeah makes perfect sense and then we would go deeper which is okay so we'll talk about maybe some better places to to meet more compatible guys what I am curious about is with what you do have available to you right now and have had available for the last 5 years **why do you think you might not be realizing the right guys when they're literally in front of you**?

*Well I I think like I always want a guy to come up to me and like ask me out okay and I feel like maybe because of my age like maybe if there was a guy that was my type like maybe they would like assume that I'm married or or something like that like I don't know if people realize that I'm looking*

**Why**? I mean **do you think you look your age**?

*No I think they look a little bit younger actually*

Okay so **why do you think guy I mean why do you think in your own words that guys wouldn't know that you're looking**? I mean **do you think guys walk around around the streets looking for a girl to have I'm looking as a bumper sticker on her forehead or no but like I don't know like even if I'm 40 enough I think I look like I'm 35 I just feel like oh if I'm at the grocery store getting my groceries like I don't know how would a guy know that I'm single and looking versus like buying groceries for my family my well my question faith is where do guys go apart from dating apps or apart from like a match making you know speed dating event where they know that a woman is looking is is that like real that guys go places and they know a woman's looking or do they see a woman that is attractive giving off the right energy and they're like oh I I just want to see if she's single**?

*Yeah I guess they wouldn't know unless I was on a dating app yeah they wouldn't know if I was looking or not*

So **it sounds like you have two options you either go on dating apps go to a speed dating event every week where you can now hold on to this rationalization that a guy needs to know that the woman is definitely looking before he's going to interact or you need to find a way where you are giving off an image or or a Vibe whatever we want to call it in normal places where a guy does want to come up to you and see if you're single so given that those are your two options right now which one of those would you prefer to do**?

*I'd rather meet someone in person for sure*

Okay and so that's perfect and so you want to meet someone in person so why do you think knowing that you do oh in fact another question I need to ask you is **you know you said you're 40 but you look 35 do you think there are guys out there that would look at you and would want to come up to you regardless of the fact that you look 35 or is that a a deal breaker and there's no guys left that would come up to you**?

*No I don't think it's a deal breaker*

Okay so **why are they not coming up to you**?

*I mean I don't I don't know why they're not coming up to me like I said I feel like maybe it was if they didn't know that I was looking but maybe I'm acting like I'm not looking*

Okay **why do you say that**?

*Well if if like you said that I guess guys don't they don't know they don't care they just will come up and ask if they're interested but if I'm if I'm giving off of vibe that I'm totally not interested I I could see that someone wouldn't even try if if that's the vibe I was giving off*

**Do you think you give off that Vibe**?

*I hadn't really thought of it before but if no one's coming up to me probably if no one I if no one I want is coming up to me then probably so*

So then the most important question is **why are you giving off a vibe to the guys that are out there that you want to meet that you're not looking when you are looking and you do want to meet them why is there an incompatibility in how you're giving off a Vibe compared to what you actually want to attract**?

*I just don't want to come across as like oh I'll go on a date with anyone but I so I don't know how to like come across as that as as someone that wouldn't go on a date with anyone but still come across as someone that's open to going out on a date*

**How much clarity do you feel you have let's call it energetically in giving off the energy to the right guys that you are looking but not giving off that same energy to the wrong guys do you feel you've ever you know I guess been trained on that or been coached through getting Clarity over those things**?

*No no I don't*

**I don't know if I know how because it it sounds like the the the energy you're giving off is not attracting the right guys attracting the wrong guys and then pushing away the right guys in other words the the vibe that you're giving off is is just sabotaging you from meeting these right guys does that make sense**?

*Yeah because I am going on dates but it's it's just not with people I want so yeah*

**Do you think there's anything else aside from this in congruency with what you're giving off that is why you're not meeting the right guys**?

*No I don't think so because I think if I did meet the right guy like everything would be good from there so I do think it's just that initial maybe like how to meet someone or what to look for like you said what kind of energy to give off*

and so **what I'm wondering is what was it about us and what we do as far as changing those energies and getting Clarity over those energies and redirecting those energies that attracted you to want help with this from us**?

*Yeah well I I watched one of your videos and something that like turned me off from other dating sites is like I am a little bit older and a little bit more mature and definitely established so I don't want to just get on a dating site where I could be match with anyone so I felt like I really related to the fact that in the video there was a girl that was my age established in her career and I felt like that like when I watch that video I'm like that's me*

Makes sense guys watch what I'm about to do here I'm going to take Faith's words and phrasing which is how people see things and use it back against her to actually wrap everything up there was two words that Faith used which were very unique words when she was describing herself put them in the chat if you got one of them or both of them and then watch what I'm about to do mature that was one of them what was the other one? Established well done guys watch this got it that makes total sense Faith so you know what I'm really hearing as far as the the problem here and and please tell me if this is accurate is your desires and your accomplishments you know what you want and having you know everything going for you to be able to have those things is very established and it's very mature but the signals that you're giving off are very unestablished and very you know immature if we could say that and therefore you've got this you know big Chasm this big void that you're trying to cross from I have everything going for me I'm successful I look five years younger than I actually am I know what I want I've been wanting that for five years you know you've got everything established on the front end but on the back end you actually becoming the woman that has established and matured the The Vibes and the signals and the energies and the you know taking the those desires and turning them into accomplishing those has not been developed and is is very unestablished **does that sound accurate to you**?

*Yeah because I never really thought of it that way but I the guys that I have been going out with are how you describe they're unmature and unestablished and that's why it's not working out*

Makes total sense so **what I'm wondering is how much longer do you want to have this in congruency between the maturity and the establishment of what you want and having the ability as far as who you are as a woman to attract that versus The Establishment and the maturity of you actually being able to turn that into reality how much longer do you want to have that that in congruence and as a result of that be spending 5 years being alone feeling lonely not going on holidays because you know you're just going to take the loneliness with you and then going and doing things like hooking up with guys for a few dates or or maybe more knowing that it's not even what you want to be doing how much longer do you want to have that in congruence in your life**?

*Not much longer I don't want to go another five like it's already been five years I don't want to go another five years*

Makes sense I mean you said not much longer and you don't want to go another five years you can go as many more days as as you'd like **yeah I don't I don't want to go any more days why not**?

*Well the longer it takes me to figure it out the longer it's going to take me to find that person and the longer it delays like everything I want to do with that person*

Well let let's be clear and let's be honest is it that it's just going to take longer you know and as we were saying at the beginning of this cool well you know I don't know when I'm going to meet that person or if you don't change and establish and mature the energy that you're giving off and the signals you're giving off **what what is the likelihood that you ever find this guy given that it's been 5 years of you not finding him**?

*Uh yeah it probably would be very low likelihood if if ever*

**Put a percentage on it 100% being I'm I'm going to find that guy and it's probably pretty soon and 0% being there's a possibility whether it's another 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years that I actually never attracted that guy given the track record of not doing it for the last 5 years what would the percentage be that some random thing is going to change now**?

*3%*

So **how much longer do you want to continue having a 3% chance that you ever get out of being lonely or if I put it another way for you how much longer do you want to have a 97% guarantee that you're going to continue to being lonely continue to not go on holidays continue to go on dates with the wrong guys and continue to just have the clock ticking not another day**?

# RE Recruit

Based on the provided excerpts from the YouTube transcript, here are the questions and phrasing that Josh suggests for the sales role play within what appears to be the first 20 minutes, focusing on the discovery phase:

Josh emphasizes a specific cadence: Ask, Respond, and then Clarify by restating the prospect's answer back to them. This restatement should focus on the core problem the prospect admits to having, even if they try to minimize it initially.

**Initial Problem Identification & Confirmation:**

* Restating the problem for confirmation:  
  * "Okay so you're finding agents but you're finding the wrong agents that don't have experience **is that correct**?"  
  * Emphasis on the lack: "So you're attracting agents but you're **not getting agents with experience**."  
  * Directly confirming the identified problem: "But you have a **massive problem with this** is that correct?"  
  * Confirming the refined restatement: "So the challenge is you're you're getting brand new agents but you're not getting the experience agents that are producing **correct**?"

**Drilling Down into Specific Data (Putting Them on the Scales):**

* Getting specific numbers related to the problem:  
  * (Using an analogy) "Get on the scales **how fat are you how heavy are you weigh yourself**."  
  * Asking for historical numbers: "**December how many experience agents did you get**?"  
  * Asking about previous months: "**What about November**?"; "**October**?"  
  * Asking about a longer period: "**Last 12 months how many experience agents did you bring on**?"  
  * Restating historical numbers for emphasis: "So you haven't attracted any experienced agents for the last two months... **no I haven't**?" (Making them say it again).

**Defining Terms and Quantifying the Problem:**

* Getting the prospect to define key terms:  
  * "**How do you define experienced**?"  
  * "**What do you mean by experienced**?"  
  * "**How exactly do you define an experienced agent**?"  
* Asking about current agent production based on the definition:  
  * "**How much are your current agents producing**?"  
  * Putting a number on the lack of production: "Okay so if you're not attracting experienced agents what type of agents are you attract him well they're not able to do blank blank blank. **Let's put a number on that**."  
* Asking about team size/structure:  
  * "**How many people on how many spots on your team or how how many downline spots do you want to have or do you have**?"  
* Quantifying agents meeting the defined criteria:  
  * "So of those 12 people **how many experienced agents producing 5 million of volume a year do you have right now**?"  
  * Asking the question again for clarity: "Okay Nicole out of the 12 agents that you have on your team **how many of them are actually doing five million in volume a year right now**?"  
* Confirming agents who are not meeting the criteria: "So 10 agents on your team are not producing and they're not hitting the 5 million that you want them to **yeah okay**?"  
* Clarifying terms like "on pace": "**How do you mean on Pace**?"  
  * Restating the "on pace" idea for confirmation: "So on Pace but no proven track record yet that they are capable of maintaining that pace and hitting it **no**?"

**Gathering More Detailed Data:**

* Asking for other relevant data points:  
  * "**How many years have you been in business**?"  
  * "**How many years have you had agent attraction**?"  
  * "**How many years have you had those experience**?"  
  * "**How many additional spots she has on the downline if any**?"  
  * Getting total volume: "So you've got 12 agents you know we've we've discussed that only two of them are on pace to be experienced producing five million you've then got another 10 agents that are you know doing blank blank blank um so **total sales volume what are you at right now**?"  
  * Suggesting getting industry numbers from the prospect: "You want the prospect to tell you the 3% then you want her to tell you the percent that she's taking."

**Challenging and Deepening the Problem:**

* Challenging the certainty of agents who are "on pace": "Okay so Nicole you said that two agents are on Pace to to hit five million a year uh **do you know for certain if you can actually ensure that they're going to get there by the end of the year**?"  
* Asking about past success in developing agents (focusing on the number): "During those four years precisely **how many agents have you taken to a high level of experience that have produced five million in volume a year**?"  
* Asking about the duration of running the team: "**How many years have you been doing agent attraction or or or how many years have you ran your team**?"  
* Tying duration to success rate (asking total agents worked with): "So four years one agent that you got to an experience level of 5 million volume a year **how many total agents have you worked with over the four years**?"  
* Confirming the calculated success/failure rate: "So out of 30 agents you only were able to really convert one agent so that's about a 3% chance... **is that fair is that accurate or do you disagree**?"  
  * Prompting for accuracy again: "**Now that you're looking at it is that accurate**?"  
  * Flipping the statistic to emphasize the failure rate: "So over 4 years **97% of all of the agents that you worked with over a 4-year period never got to the experience level of making 5 million volume a year is that accurate**?"  
  * Adding time and effort to the failure rate: "So **97% of all of the time and effort that you spent over the last four years working with agents never got them to a 5 million a year experience level**."

**Addressing Deflections and Ownership:**

* Drilling into potential deflections (e.g., agent churn reasons):  
  * "**Why why is that**?"  
  * "**Why why does how much money they have to spend matter**?"  
  * "**So why why are they not willing to invest that money**?"  
  * Challenging the deflection with questions about ROI: "**Would they pay for those leads and continue to pay for their license if the return on that investment was significantly greater than the expense**?"  
  * Framing the issue: "**So is it an issue with the cost or is it an issue with having a proven system that allows them to get a multiple on that investment**?"  
  * Asking who is responsible for agent success: "**And who in terms of the downline who is in charge of making sure that the time and the effort and the systems and the processes are generating a significant return on investment for the agents in your downline**?"  
  * Rephrasing the question about agents leaving based on ROI: "**Would they have chosen chosen to leave you and leave the industry if the amount of money that they were generating was a significant multiple of the money that they were investing**?"  
  * Bringing ownership back to the prospect: "**So is it an issue with the industry and the market and agents or is it an issue that you don't have what you need to keep your agents**?"  
  * Directly asking who owns the problem: "**So either way you have a potential issue with what you're giving your agents... or you have an issue with attracting better agents so either way who who's got the issue**?"

**Exploring Reasons for Production Differences:**

* Asking why the prospect's agents produce significantly less: "So why do you think your agents are only producing 500,000 when you're producing 25.5 million **why do you think that is**?"  
* Clarifying the reasons given (Experience, Training, Drive):  
  * "When you say experience **what exactly do you mean**?"  
  * "**How long**?"  
  * "Aside from the the time... **any other particular reason you think they're producing so much less than you**?"  
  * "Okay who **who's training**?"  
  * "Okay so you you might not have the right training to help them produce it closer to what you're producing **is that what saying right**?"  
  * "**Anything else**?"  
  * "And and **do they get anything on that from your team in house**?"  
  * "But you don't think it's working at the level that it it needs to be **could be part of the problem**?"  
* Summarizing the core problem as attraction vs. development: "So if we broke that down into two things that is costing you... it's both your attraction and your development inh house that is causing you to not be able to get agents that are producing closer to what you're producing **is that accurate**?"  
    
* Do you have a preference Nicole in terms of like you know let's say we could wave a magic wand and you could just have experien people that are already trained and already are maybe more professional and they have their own drive **would you rather just attract them or do you want to like train people up and you know give them the drive do you have a preference there**?  
* **Any particular reason why**?  
* So you you don't even want to be facilitating training facilitating motivation having to rarr everybody together and you know keep the mat producing **you just want highly experienced agents that are driven that are well trained that are just to come in and allow you to get out of the business whilst growing the business exactly**?  
* So **why do you think you've been only attracting agents with one or two years of experience in the last four years**?  
* So **why do you think you're not attracting more experienced agents that could be producing ing closer to the number that you're producing which would allow you to leave the business**?  
* **Why do you want to leave the business**?  
* **What would you need to be being produced by agents in terms of volume so that you could leave**?  
* Okay you know **what experience level do you think that would be**?  
* Okay cool so that's what you need and this is what you have **why hasn't that happened**?  
* **Why do you feel like your eight agents that are each doing half a million a year are not able to replicate the level of production that you're at being at 25.5 million**?  
* When you say experience **what exactly do you mean**?  
* **How long**?  
* Okay so you have 25 years of experience in the business your agent has agents have a one to two years so you're roughly just highballing it here agents have two years **12 times 12 to 13 times more experienced than your agents**?  
* So **why do you think you're attracting agents that only have one or two years of experience meanwhile you're 25 times more experienced than them why why do you think you're attracting that low level of Agents**?  
* Have you ever thought about just going by yourself and just increasing your own production because I could be like **it sounds like you saw a lot of work because you're right like what you said earlier how um she's probably doing training with them and all these things so like why not just go off on your own and just being and then her goal will come out on why she wants to build a team that's what I was thinking actually**?  
* Why **do you want to get out**?  
* **Was there any particular moment that kind of pred you to book this cool with you know thinking about kids and realizing you're basically trapped in the business and you won't be able to do that where you thought I need outside help I I need to fix this one way or another I'm going to book a call what was kind of the the moment for you**?  
* So **why us**?  
* **What is it about those late hours** missing time with family?  
* **How many kids have you got**?  
* **What are their names**?  
* **What are their ages**?  
* **What specifically are you missing out on**?  
* Can I ask you a strange personal question yes **did your dad put you to bed**?  
* **How do you think that impacted your you know future**?  
* If you were to just imagine **what do you think your life would have looked like if you had a dad that wasn't present**?  
* So Nicole you mentioned you want to build this team because you want to stop producing yourself **why is that**?  
* Exactly **how old are my kids**?  
* When you have had to work late at night and you're working weekends and you you can't be there for them **how do you think that impacts them**?  
* Okay good so you got two kids six and four and you mention you want to take a step back **tell me about that**?  
* What **what does take a step back mean to to you specifically**?  
* When when I heard you say step back maybe I just misinterpreted it I was kind of imagining that you want to step back from the business and into a different reality maybe that's related to what you're saying about your kids **is is that is that accurate**?  
* And so you're saying 60 hours plus down to 30 take a step back **what do you want those extra 30 hours for in in regards to stepping back to something alternative**?  
* You you said be around **how much would you say you are around at the moment for your 6-year-old and your four-year old**?  
* And I kind of get the sense that that's bothering you **yeah yeah it it definitely does and he's he's also not happy about it as well**?  
* If you were to um focus on which of those is most important at the moment I know they're both important but just to kind of hone in on something **are we having a conversation about how this is affecting your relationship with your husband or are we having a conversation right now about how this is affecting your kids**?  
* Oh so it's it's not that it's affecting your relationship with your husband it's that your husband has told you it's affecting the kids **yeah and you potentially feel it's affecting the kids as well**?  
* **What exactly did he say to you**?  
* And you know sometimes husband and wife have differing opinions **where does your opinion lie as to what your husband said to you**?  
* Are you at a point where what your husband's saying and your opinion of it and you know the fact that you do have to work **are you at a point where you're like no I need to change this I I need to fix the downline attract higher quality attract more experienced agents that can produce you know the 40 20 million whatever the number was that you're producing and take a step back and be more present at home or are you at the point where you're like yeah I see my husband's point it it probably is affecting the kidss but no I I just have to keep working and and it is what it is**?  
* Oh so you also want to take a step back **do you mean like for your own health and happiness or or are you referring to you want to take a step back for the kids or those separate things**?  
* Okay both okay **why do you want to take a step back just for you**?  
* **Can you give me example of like something where you've prioritized your work over yourself**?  
* Is there any conflict between you and your husband over this amount of hours that you're working because you don't have a downline that would allow you to move away from the business take a step back he's very supportive but yeah he's just we're both on the same page you know that the kids are young and they want their mom to be around **all right I'm going to pause there**?  
* Do I need to go specifically into **how it impacts her kids**?  
* Okay got it so I'm clear on you know husband stress Family Health Nutrition Etc the kids you said that your kids want their mom there **how do you know that**?  
* **What exactly do they say**?  
* And in regards to your kids wanting you there to read to them and you know put them to bed **how do you feel about that as far as Parenthood**?  
* **Do you feel it's something you need to give your children or do you feel it's something that would be a nice to have but if I can't then I'll just keep working or how important is that do you feel**?  
* And **how did that affect you growing up**?  
* Interesting **how do you feel you would have felt in regards to being loved and being cared for if your mom and dad were only around four hours a day**?  
* **How do you think your kids are feeling the same thing**?  
* **How does that make you feel**?  
* **What about that makes you feel lucky**?  
* **Are you at the point where you're no longer willing to keep robbing your children of feeling like they have a loving and caring mother**?  
* **Why not**?

# Biz\_Opp

* Focusing on specific positive cash flow over a period (e.g., last 30 days).

* Asking specifically about salary and hours worked *before* starting the business full-time to compare to business income and hours.  
* Highlighting the comparison between hours worked and income earned before and after going full-time in the business.  
* Asking about the prospect's perception of their hourly rate comparison.  
* Asking about the comparison of responsibility/stress between the job and running the business.  
* Asking directly why the prospect doesn't just go back to a job.  
* Asking if the prospect has reached a point where they feel they need help.  
* Asking *why* they think the business hasn't grown despite effort (to get them to state the need for guidance/plan).  
* Asking what has changed *now* that they are seeking help.

Okay, so you've been in business four years coming on five so we're talking about the business not growing business not scaling end of year one profit you

*sorry you cut out on me that you said end of year one and then I didn't hear anything*

What was your profit end of first year in business end of first year

*so honestly the first year I was running this business I had to still work my 9 to5 while I was getting it off the ground*

When you say profit you mean profit total for the year for year one

*correct*

correct

*I I think like 40 50k*

**All right I'm good to jump back in I got you so so 40 50k after year 1 where were you after year two**

*so year two it started to pick up a bit and that was actually the year that I was able to really leave at at the end of year two I was able to step away from my 95 I would say the business like in terms of gross revenue for year two it did in the ballpark of about 300K*

300K okay

*yeah so 300K you stepped out of your bit you stepped out of year 9 to5 went all in how about year three*

Hang on hang on he changed the terminology got be careful prospects do this $40 $50,000 profit year two blank Revenue he's changing the varibles you got to be careful

*yep got it*

**so year two 300K in Revenue what was your what was your net profit what'd you take home that year**

*uh I think for myself personally it was like 90,000 before tax*

Again you you flip the terms again Revenue profit take home personal income that they're different they're all different and what I would have done but you wanted to jump in is I was going to ask a follow-up question to my 40 50k **okay so you made 40 50k profit how much did you pay yourself on the end of year one of business**

*just answer that Anthony I didn't pay myself anything because I was still worth my job*

Got okay and then year two you said 300,000 Revenue **how much profit did you take from the business**

*did I take or did the business makers*

the business take yeah business profit

*so business profit I think it was in the realm of like doing probably like 50% margin so like maybe 150*

**okay so year 1 40 to 50 year 2 150 and what did you pay yourself in year two**

*I paid myself it was about 90 grand and then I left like 60k in the business account from that profit yeah so 150 \- 90 60k left*

**okay so from year 1 to year 2 you 3x the business so you had some growth and you had some scale then but a a part of that potentially is because you'd gone from part-time to to full-time**

*yeah yeah exactly yeah*

Okay makes sense **what about year three** and then you carry on from there MJ so you see what I'm doing and as I'm doing this we're now having a conversation about not growing and not scaling but I actually am now proving the pain that you know okay so and what's going to be weird to see what Anthony does here is like you know so he he 3x when he went from parttime to full-time what happened the next year when he was full-time to another year of full-time did it grow or did it stay the same now we've got a timeline of like okay so and it might stay the same for the next year after that so it might be and you don't have to play this Prospect Anthony do whatever you want but it might be okay so for the last three years since you've been

full-time in the business you haven't grown or scaled at all year on year on year is that correct

*yes*

**you see the pain so you've been running a business for three years and it hasn't improved right** and so then I've got my zoom in okay so you you haven't grown or scaled for three years and we'll get into the reasons you said swings and volatility and unpredictability with cash flow we'll get into details of that but **did something change that now after 3 years of with all due respect wasting your time in other words putting in time and effort and not moving forward that we're now on this call**

*yeah*

**okay so that was year two 365 days later of you working fulltime in the business what was the results**

f quick questions um **before you went full-time in the business what was your salary**

*it was like 80 grand a year*

**okay so your salary before was 80k and was that full-time or part-time that you were working a job**

*no that that was full-time*

Okay so that was fulltime so 80k full-time you then went into the business first year was kind of part-time you know you you made 50 Grand Revenue but didn't pay yourself second year 300K Revenue paid yourself 90 so **you'd paid yourself $10,000 more from going full-time in business than your salary before you got into business** and then when you were now full-time in the business you know people say I'm full-time in business **how many hours were you actually working a week full-time in business over the last year from year two to year three how many hours was that**

*I mean we weekly average we like honestly probably like 90 hours on average*

80 90 hours okay so 90 hours a week times 52 weeks so 4, 680 hours later you had gone well that was 4,680 hours later from the first year fulltime let's actually times that by 2 years cuz that's since you left your job so so okay so **9,360 hours later and 2 years of your life from quitting your job you were now paying yourself $20,000 extra so 9,360 hours of time and effort two years of your life and your salary has now gone from $80,000 a year to $100,000 a year is that correct**

*yeah yeah*

Okay **what about year four** and then I would move on but look at how I'm just stacking him he's just like fuck I I I took that many hours I worked two years I went from 880,000 to 100,000 I might even add another question **quick question aside from the fact that it was 2 years your life and you know $20,000 extra a year which if we break that down $20,000 divided by 2 years divided by 12 months so you basically paid yourself from quitting a job to going into business 2 years later you were now paying yourself $830 extra a month that was the increase that you've given yourself from going into business full-time**

yeah so like at the end of your monthly salary when you were full-time in a job **the difference now that you've spent two years building a business is you're paying yourself $800 more a month that that's what's changed in your life**

*there like and you're working double the hours*

I'm going to get to that as well okay yeah one step at a time okay so $800 extra a month **does that sound about average like about accurate like when you look at your expenses and your income is that basically what you're noticing hey I'm running a business but I'm basically making 800 bucks more a month**

*yeah well like I didn't want to take all the money out of the business I probably could have paid myself bit more but yeah*

If you if you'd have made more money in the business if you hadn't had so much volatility and unpredictability you could have paid yourself a lot more yeah that's why we're on the call anyway so $800 now another question is uh you you said you're working 90 hours when you said you were full-time before **how many hours were you working full time**

*I would I would probably average it like 45 hours a week some weeks yeah*

Okay got it so **so you've worked double the amount of hours for $20,000 more which I'm not going to calculate it for you uh you can in your own time if you want but are we on the same page that your hourly rate has significantly gone down does that make sense to you**

*yeah*

And then one other question before we move on is when you were working 45 hours in a job **how did that compare as far as like responsibility and stress and having to manage things compared to running a business for 90 hours like did you feel that 45 hours working someone else was just easier relatively speaking as far as responsibility**

*yeah of course*

So **so what I'm wondering is why not just go back to a job**

*well I mean I know that you know like if I smash it out of the park in business I can earn so much more than what I could ever earn working a job so like I want to push through and I I want to see that and I I think the thing that's motivated me is like although it is not money I've been able to take home just seeing like even $350,000 transacted in a year it's it's like it's motivating me to know that it's like possible*

I understand your point and I don't want to you know put put a dampener on that and I love what you're saying as far as you you want to uh smash this out so that you have a much higher earning potential but and again I'm not saying this to criticize you

I'm just saying it so that we've got a sense of reality here it's kind of like the guy going to a strip club and saying oh I'm looking at all the hot girls so yeah but dude they're not going home with you like you're making 300 Grand Revenue but you're paying yourself half just above half of what you were earning so **what I'm curious about is have you gotten to the point where you feel that you need help to actually take home more money from running a business**

*yeah yeah definitely*

**Okay good it right**

# BecomeFreelancer

Okay.

my idea was right now to just get more data on where he's currently at to understand a little bit better like how that fits into his bigger perspective but very clear to me is like there's going to be a big objection of like trusting in the process of freelancing it enough so we'll have to very likely go deep into um get getting to understand where the hesitancy is coming from and also the confidence in himself to actually making that work that's what I hear so far.

I agree with the objection that we need to make sure that he has the trust do you remember that on some trainings I've mentioned that objections actually just disappear if someone has enough of a reason to get out of their current situation.

so where I would have gone a bit different is we're kind of going now into the background and I understand that you might need to do that for qualification purposes but I would have just gone straight into this guy's pain.

he said two things he said I want more money and I want to do more things in my life okay.

so I would have just gone straight into diving into that I could have said something like okay got it so you got to that point now where with what you're doing now it's not going to allow you to make the money that you want to make and it's preventing you from doing some of the things you want to do in your life is that accurate.

*Yes.*

**okay how much money are you making right.**

I would have just gone straight into the pain.

**quantify the money quantify in what way his current job is preventing him from doing some of the things in his life.**

is it Financial is it time is it that he's bored is it that he's not motivated in life is that he he's lost his Mojo he's not you know got any purpose anymore.

I need to dig into what he has given me which is the money and the things in my well things in his life okay.

it's a weird one because he said oh I don't know who to listen to and I don't know what steps to make and it's like do we go after that or do we go after the money the things in my life.

well **you always always always have to go for the pain and the problem first** because no matter how beautiful your preh handling of the trust and who to listen to objection was going to be if you haven't gone deep enough into why they even care about this and get them to really cough up the truth about what's going on nothing you say to preh handle the objection is going to do anything.

so you got to get them really like feet to the fire that they need to change their job right now before you really want to go too deep into anything else okay.

all right um we'll jump back into the role play Matt obviously you know to be a a prospect that would be qualified uh are you clear on what changes you need to make on that is that clear to you.

*So my yeah my job then would be I'm in it currently or I've um I've already done the type of work uh in an agency possibly but I want to go into a freelance I want to do it on my own ex something like that okay.*

exactly yeah beautiful got.

and then for Valentine you can jump back into the role play wherever you want so you can jump in where we finished or you can go back a few questions however you want to do it and then we'll just go from there okay.

got it okay okay.

pause pause quickly.

he gave you the answer but it wasn't really like this is exactly what I do with the money every single month and the reason for that is because you minced the question you were like you know kind of I can't even remember how you worded it but instead of just saying **okay and what do you do with the $1,500 remaining.**

if you'd have just been more direct with the question he has to give a more specific more direct answer.

so I can't remember how you worded the question but you kind of like beat around the bush with the question so like what about the rest of the money or something and then because of the way you phrased the question he kind of danced around the answer as well.

and it's really really important that we know what he's doing with that $1,500.

number one because it gives us an idea of what else he's got going on.

number two it's going to allow us to say depending on what he's doing well why not do more of that.

if you he said crypto so I'd say **okay got it and so like I guess if you were to put it as a percentage what percentage of your make money goals are you betting on crypto.**

and he might be like oh you know I think it would be a good way for me to make a bunch of money blah blah blah I'm pretty hopeful I think I know what I'm doing.

why is that important cuz then I'd say **so what I'm wondering is you know if you've already started in crypto you've been investing in crypto why not just do more of that instead of getting a new job or getting into freelancing.**

because it's kind of an objection it's like well what are you doing with the rest of the money you're trying to multiply it so what shifted in his mind that he no longer wants to try and multiply his wealth with crypto that he wants to move into freelancing.

that's why I would have wanted to know that.

the final thing that I would have wanted to know uh about what he's doing with that 1500 is just kind of getting an idea of um what he's got available in terms of savings like if he's saying he's putting all of it into crypto you know he might not have any lump some anyway so there's a lot of information we could have got out of wording that question a little bit better okay.

**just you know with the crypto investing what's kind of your idea there**.

**pause**.

so you you know you've put this amount into crypto **what is the idea there.**

it also comes across as much more curious as opposed to salesy when I'm like okay what's the idea there are you trying to do this you trying to do that that they feel like you're fishing they feel like you're trying to pull some information out of them.

whereas when you just leave it as a very small question okay so you've been doing that for 6 months what's kind of the idea there oh I want to do this I want to do that and they're going to open up to you.

the more you back off with the questions the more they're going to come forward with the answers.

the more you bulldoze them with your question the more they're just going to you know contract and give you like a tiny little response.

I could have gone way deeper of course on what he mentioned um that uh he for example he has to kiss his boss ass right which is very visual so I could have that like just went way deeper into like what that actually means.

and the other bit was asking for time off.

right now they are like layer one of the onion asking for time off kissing ass.

we need to bury him in in both of those things because during the process of burying him in those two things we might find holy shit this is bothering Matt so much he's going to give me 10 grand to learn how to do freelancing.

or we try and bury him in that and we're like you know what this isn't enough like we need to find some other data and some other pain points.

**so you said you know uh asking for time off kissing ass is it fair to say like one of the issues if we were to kind of put a label on it is time Freedom like your time and you having the freedom to do what you want with your time.**

*yeah 100%.*

**okay um kissing ass who who who specifically asked you have to kiss.**

*uh there's a couple of people but like most of it is like my direct supervisor um yeah if I'm not if if I'm not like to the tea to the letter on everything like he just gets in my face and you know like he he he's doing it like to he's not doing it to like be he's not out of line with like what the job requires but the the way he goes about it just he knows he's like he's like twisting the knife with me uh because I've had several conversations with him about it and he still just doesn't want to you know I guess just stop being an asshole about it.*

**okay um what I'm hearing is it's this specific supervisor that you don't like I mean have you gone to the other supervisor and I guess made a complaint about this supervisor or you know just go and find a new job in a different company with a different supervisor that's maybe a nicer more tolerant person why why not just do that.**

*um yeah I mean I did go uh above and I was that's that's why I said it was like kind of two people because like the this the the my supervisor's Supervisor was just pretty tonedef to it and was like just keep doing your job like stop complaining kind of attitude and and he's like the VP so I I didn't I just kind of felt shut down and I don't I'm I'm just yeah I just don't want to like keep going through like if I went to another job like I'm taking on the chance that this is going to happen again um and I I'd I'd rather see if I can just do something on my own and be my own boss instead because at least I won't have to put up with this shit.*

**specific words that you said there that felt very um you know deep for you is being shut down how many times have you wanted to live your life and you know do the things you want to do and go to the places you want to go to and do them at the times you want to do them and you just got shut down.**

*um yeah I mean it it's uh the most recent one was like a month ago okay um that that's when I was really like you know wanting to to get back into being serious about starting something freelance but how many times do this happen total if you were to Ballpark the number.*

**oh man like six seven times since I've been here okay yeah so so I'm what I'm curious about is did something change this last time that having been willing to be shut down six times previously this time was different and if so why.**

*um I think it was it's just a culmination of it like it's not like they're in my eyes I guess they're not like major things it's just like hey I wanna you know can I take a a Monday off and and have a long weekend or a Friday off and have a long weekend and uh I just see I see I just see other my other co-workers like getting that and for me um they get it pretty they get it pretty easy but like for me it's like I I get it like maybe once every like three months every four months that they'll say yes to it and I just I feel like it's they're just not being fair to me about it and um I'm just tired of somebody dictating when I can have time off what I can be doing.*

**understood my my question is you weren't too tired for the first six times to do something about it if you are why are you now too tired to let this happen another time**.

*um I guess this this last time well so this this last time is um my my my sister is um she's moving out of the country and and so she got married a couple years ago but her husband um just recently took a job in Australia and and so they're moving and I wanted to just have a couple days off to to spend some more time with them before they move and because somebody had already requested that off and and I and and for me was kind of almost last minute um they just denied it and so and I tried explaining to him about like the situation I tried calling the person who uh you talking to to my cooworker who had taken that time off too and just it didn't end up working out and I was just like I don't want to miss because like I I don't know the next time I'm gonna see her I don't know the next time I'm gonna see like you know my her kids like my my nieces and nephews and I don't I don't want to have to be in that position anymore where I'm just like beholden to somebody else not not if I can like you know do something on my own and I've already been doing it it's just I just don't know how to make it like a business I just I've already been doing it with you know friends and people that I know on the side so I just want to know how to like how do I turn that into something fulltime.*

**so what I'm hearing is that previously you were shut down for you know maybe going taking a Monday off going wind surfing doing some things that whilst they were things you enjoy it was kind of like more day-to-day things whereas this more recent time was like shit if I don't go and work for myself being an employee is controlling how I can be as a family member is that where this is kind of transitioned into something more serious.**

*yeah it's it is it's I um grow growing up I mean I didn't get a lot of time with my my sister and so um you know over the last few years we've we've become really close and so it's frustrating it's just um you know I don't want to um I guess lose touch and I know we won't lose touch there's all kinds of ways but I just that that personal time with her before she would take off was really important to me and um yeah so getting shut down on it really just really just pissed me off.*

understood all right we'll pause the role play there.

do you see Valentine how like just taking those two things he said goes from asking for time off and kissing ass to being shut down to how many times were you shut down to then me being curious of like well it happened six times and you didn't really do anything about it what's changed now oh well now it's about family now his sister's involved in the conversation.

it's like from one thing peeling the layers off of the onion we've almost got to the point where I could probably close him I'm probably like three questions away from being able to close.

so what I'm hearing is that previously you were shut down for you know maybe going taking a Monday off going wind surfing doing some things that whilst they were things you enjoy it was kind of like more day-to-day things whereas this more recent time was like shit if I don't go and work for myself being an employee is controlling how I can be as a family member is that where this is kind of transitioned into something more serious.

so **how much longer are you willing to be an employee and getting shut down to spend your time in your own way when you want how you want.**

because I'm going to sell him not on becoming a freelancer on choosing to no longer be willing to be an employee.

because especially for an employee I need them to choose to break free from choosing to be an employee.

we need him to realize you chose to be an employee you chose to be an employee the first time you got shut down you chose to be an employee the second time you got shut down.

every single time that you put yourself back in the same situation is because you continued to choose to be an employee.

he could have worked harder on getting into freelancing he could have bought a course he could have done this he could have done that he didn't do enough that he was willing to do whatever it takes to not be an employee anymore.

so I have to get him to realize that through questions.

okay so you know you want to spend time with your family when important things come up and you put in a request for time off and you know basically you get shut down and told no \- **why do you feel you're in this situation.**

**why do you feel like you continue to be in this situation.**

he might say oh it's a shit boss he might say well it's because you know I'm an employee I need to lead him to that point where he realizes it's because he's chosen to stay as an employee.

and I'll just stay in that holding pattern around and around and around until he comes to the realization because without the pain and the problem and the realization of what needs to change I won't make the sale but with both those two things that's it I don't really need anything else.

I just need him to the light bulb moment that I need this guy to realize is **all of the current pains and current problems he is facing is because he is choosing to be an employee.**

once once he has that light bulb moment it's like he can't unsee it he'll never ever go back to work as an employee again without realizing shit I'm consciously choosing to put myself in this situation another day.

and that's the transformation mentally that you need the prospect to have on the sales core is that clear.

so I'd say **so the problem I'm really hearing is that whilst you don't want to be experiencing the negatives of being an employee you also haven't gotten clear on that just being the choices you're making by being an employee.**

**in other words you understand the problems that you're in but you haven't come to the realization of what's causing those problems and really whether it's right or wrong if you're an employee and someone else is giving you a salary you are being paid to work when they want you to work and if you don't do the work that they want at the level they want when they want it they will fire you.**

**in other words your life is not in your hands your life is not in your control.**

**but it doesn't sound like right now you've come to that realization and so I would say at this point we don't have alignment because anybody that we would consider teaching how to be a freelancer has come to the realization that anything but being your own boss is willingly choosing to be someone else's employee.**

**in other words do what they say when they say.**

**if you get to that point sometime in the future more than happy to revisit things but at the moment if you haven't come to that realization we wouldn't be aligned.**

now at that point you're probably going to go oh actually now I've come to the realization.

*No no I was I was actually going to say no no that's that's that's why I'm here that's 30 30 days ago this was enough it was the final store.*

yep and and then you don't move on.

you have to tie them down.

I'd say **so what changed from a minute ago when you didn't seem to have that dot connected in your mind what shifted in the last five seconds.**

*I was just making excuses for right it's it's my responsibility.*

hey don't go I you know I really want to do this I'm like I don't believe you.

**I I just don't feel like you really know what you want and that's totally fine I'm not judging you I'm not criticizing you but we work with people that know this is what they want and you're not at that point yet.**

**you may get there in the next two hours when you get off this call and you go and stare at the wall and realize your life isn't where you want it to be but I'm not going to assume that you've had that realization because Tony Robbins and just made you realize it in the last 60 seconds I'm not that good you know.**

I I'll probably play some jokes in there and basically just let them know that like you haven't transformed your perspective in the last 30 seconds but if you go away and you spend the next 2 24 hours and you think this through and you come back to me tomorrow and you're like you know what you're 100% right I'm not where I want to be and it's my fault and this is what I need to do to get where I want to be and I'm going to do that right now you text me I'll see what my availability is over the next couple days we'll book in a time and we'll get you on boarded right so yeah.

# Tax Planning

Josh: got it so $140,000 that sound about right *Prospect (played by Josh): yeah*

Josh: **okay and that being the case why did you start paying yourself more this year in comparison to Prior years** *Prospect (played by Josh): we we've just actually had twins*

Josh: okay got it so you're paying yourself more this year compared to last year I'm curious what led to you increasing how much personal income you're taking from the business just pure curiosity

Josh: okay so the incomes your income's gone up by $125,000 take profit is that correct *Prospect: yes*

Josh: **so what I'm wondering is given that you've grown the business you know you're taking home more you're doing better and we're now on a call about you know tax planning and reduction is there any type of relationship between those two things**

Josh: okay got it **any particular reason you haven't crunched the numbers**

Josh: **any particular reason you haven't crunched the numbers**

Josh: when did you look at that

Josh: okay well given that it was yesterday why are we on the phone so quick

Josh: did something change

Josh: given that it was only 6 hours ago why did you book in a call with me so soon

Josh: given that it was four months ago well you know why are we only talking now

Josh: **any particular reason you did not sit down and crunch the numbers**

okay got it so that's awesome you know you obviously Focus you made sure to not get any distractions and really just you know do what you do best so given that we're on the phone today as far as something you know probably not in your day-to-day things where does tax planning and tax reduction fit within your points what you do best distractions right now

Josh (continuing roleplay): **so you want you want it basically to just be taken off your plate correct**

Josh (continuing roleplay): **What about because the other thing I'm curious about is you know you you say that one of the key decisions that you made a year ago which has worked**

Josh (continuing roleplay): **so well to make you more money was not focusing on anything that doesn't need to be focused on right now where does tax planning and reduction fit for you right now as far as this needs to be done but I just don't have the time for it or yeah this is not really that important but if someone can do it for me anyway I'll I'll just get it off my plate where where does it kind of fit in that**

Josh: okay so you know if if reducing your tax bill would make you so much more money like what's stopping you figuring that out on your own

Josh: Okay so you've told me that one of the ways that you make decisions uh in the last 12 months is focus doing what you do best and not getting distracted that's beautiful so you tell me where does this thing that I'm going to sell you fit within your mental model

Josh: oh so you know you've been following these mental models for the last 12 months it's worth very well for you you tell me where does tax planning and strategy fit within your frame work

Josh: the only thing else that I'm really wondering Dr Robin is like was there anything that attracted you to us as far as being the guys to get this done in a timely manner and also in a way that's not going to you know burden you with more things to do like was there anything that stood out to you

Josh (acknowledging referral): okay so you already I don't need to tell you that we do things very quickly and we try not to involve you as much as possible

Josh (asking if anything else is needed): um is there anything else because you know that that conversation was pretty quick was is there anything else that we haven't covered that you think I need to know

Josh (transitioning to offer): **Beau well listen if if you need this done in 60 days and you do not want to have more things on your plate because you know what has worked for you over the last 12 months being focused doing what you do best and not getting distracted we can absolutely make that happen if you want me to take you through very briefly a through to Z what happens what we're going to do for you not what you need to do what we're going to do so you don't have to I can just take you through that very quickly**

# Leadgen

Here are the questions suggested or asked by Josh during the training and role-play segments:

* So out of those 12 leads in the past 30 days Colin what was the quality like  
* How was the quality  
* How many turned into sales  
* What is a sale worth to you right now  
* What is your price point  
* Okay what happened to those 27 leads (*that didn’t close*)  
* And ballparking the number how long did you spend on each of those phone calls  
* okay interesting and let's now shift over into um another cost for you in terms of those 27 leads how are you generating those leads  
  * okay how much are you spending a month  
  * who's taking the phone calls  
  * hm interesting and correct me if I'm wrong you're the business owner so as a business owner instead of spending your time on the business you're spending your time on sales calls that aren't converting I'm curious is that taking your time away from anything else in the business  
* **I'm curious is that taking your time away from anything else in the business**  
* **How does it feel as a business owner to be spending your time taking sales calls with dead leads**  
* How many calls did you have just ballpark the number in the past month  
* **Of those 27 leads that didn't close how many of them did you actually speak to?**  
* Roughly how long were you spending on each call  
* Of those 25 leads that you spoke to how long did you spend on the call with each of them on average  
* **Of those 25 leads that you spoke to that didn't close how long was it taking you on average to find out that they didn't have the finances**  
* 18 hours in what time period  
* **When you hear that contextually how does that make you feel?**  
* Did I understand that correctly?

* How long has this been like this in the business?  
* **Manto man how does this make you feel**  
* Is there anything you're curious about why why think why why didn't he think it was costing him that much  
* so I'm very curious i understand Colin that you didn't think it's cost you as much as you hopefully have now realized what did you realize it was costing you that led you to being on this call  
* **Understood how bad did you realize it was and why did you then take action to want to fix it now**  
* How many or as a percentage close rate what do you think would be a reasonable close rate percentage for this offer that you've constructed at this price point if you had quality leads  
* **Okay but how do how does it given the fact that you're wasting your time right now Colin how does how does that sit with you**  
* **So what did you notice**  
* You weren't reaching the potential in your business in what way exactly  
* Okay so you realize that you want to be earning more so how how much are you earning right now just ballpark the number  
* **and so what I'm what I'm what I'm wondering Colin is you know you hadn't really realized the the gravity of the cost of this you knew it was costing you something but you didn't know it was this bad you mentioned you've tried a few different solutions and they didn't work out what was the turning point where you were committed to trying something else again what was that shift for you**  
* **So so you saw someone else in the same industry as you that accomplished your dream numbers way quicker than you and that kind of obliterated this I guess assumption that your numbers and your challenges in your business would just that was just your business and your industry and what what did that then make you realize is the problem and the reciprocal of that is the solution**  
* It's you in what way  
* The what what skills  
* **And so what do you need to get those copy and marketing skills so that you can get the leads in so that you can get your business to what you now know is totally reasonable after seeing your friend who's recently started a business hit those numbers what do you need to get those skills**  
* **Okay why us what was it about us that attracted you to giving you that help you need to get these skills**  
* Are you going to be like an easy sale then  
* *Summarize, include limiting belief concepts*  
* I forgot to ask you when did you have that conversation with your friend when was that  
* is that all accurate  
* Is there anything else we haven't covered that you think I should know  
* If you want me to walk you through um essentially A through to Z how we make that happen then uh I can take you through that 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* Why   
* why now  
* Tell me a story  
* Why did that affect you  
  * Was there a recent moment?  
* How much longer  
* Why us

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* What changed question  
* Yeah why do you think I'm doing that  
* So you're telling me that I'm doing something that is in alignment with what you know you need to do  
* Why haven't you  
* When do you need to make a change  
* What is the timeline that you're putting on that  
* Once you have all the information after these two extra meetings what are you going to do over those two days  
* How long does it take you to know which one of those three once you have all the information is going to give you the highest likelihood of having success  
* **Any particular reason you wanted to give yourself another 23 hours to not make a decision**  
* **Why is there an incongruence between how long it does take to make a decision and how long you're holding yourself to making a decision why is there a 24x increase in the amount of time you're giving yourself to make a decision versus how long you actually know it takes to make a decision**  
* Was was that a response based on it being a rushed decision or once you have all the information are you just going to know which is the best choice

* Okay well why do you want to smoke  
* Well why do you want to try it  
* Why don't you want to try jumping off a cliff  
  —----------ecom—----------  
* Okay so why not just keep trying  
* **So what was the turning point where you moved away from being glad you've tried to no longer willing to keep trying the way you have been**  
* **H how did that moment shift your approach to just trying to figure things out on your own**  
* What how were those connected  
* I understand that what I'm not clear on is why that situation with your parents made you have that realization  
* **Why are you in a position where you can't help these people that need your help**  
* **And so where are you at now with that laziness and that you know um lack of commitment to getting the help you needed  Is this is this situation with your parents enough to get you past any fear of change or fear of doing something different and completely changing the way that you operate**  
* **Is that money that you have now enough to support your family and knowing that over another 1500 hours if if you keep doing what you've been doing it will only go up by another $600 is that enough to support your family**  
* Over what time period would it be enough  
* **When you hear that number how does that make you feel knowing that you can support them for three months**  
* **But why are you comparing it to nothing rather than comparing it to being able to support them 100% by having the money to do it**  
* **Do you think do you think part of the problem in regards to why you're not able to support your family full-time is this mindset of always regressing back to fear and scarcity and pessimism and and it's not even safety but false sense of security which is well I could just support them a little bit**  
* Okay well there's nothing wrong with being afraid what matters is what has this fear already cost your parents in terms of the support that they needed and what is it going to continue to cost them when the 3 months of funds that you have runs out  
* **What if in 3 months they don't get the support they need and they die and you know that that was because you let your fear run your decisions then what how many more years are you going to have to live with that guilt and shame**  
* What if the probability that that happens is 5% it's very small  
* **Are you willing to actually gamble a 5% chance that you don't give your parents the support that they need and they die**  
* **Yeah what are you going to do**  
* Probably or you will make it work  
* **If it's maybe then with all due respect it just doesn't seem like you love your parents enough to actually take this seriously and it's a little bit saddening for me on this side of the table to see that you're actually gambling with your parents' life over just facing your fears and actually committing to doing what it takes**  
* **Okay why**  
* **Are you losing money or are you investing money to increase the chance**  
* **Is it like losing money or are you investing the money to get a better result**  
* **and this is going to be a little bit confusing but increase the chance from a 100% chance of failure that you will not support your parents after 3 months down to a 50% chance in your words I think it's much better than that but 50% chance that you know you lose the money and nothing works out which isn't going to happen but I'm just playing with your current mental models it's not losing money Alex you're investing something to go from a 100% chance of failure to in your mind a 50% chance of failure which is also a 50% chance of success that you actually support your parents so is it like losing money or are you investing the money to get a better result**  
* **And so why now you I mean we spent 15 minutes me trying to care more about your parents than you were caring about your own parents why now has something changed**  
* **So how much longer are you going to let your own choice to be irrational in your thinking risk your parents' future whether that be worst case scenario they pass away or best case scenario they have to live the rest of their life stressed about fear how much longer are you going to let your irrationality put that burden on the people that have bent over backwards to put you into this world**  
* **Okay why not**  
* **What can I say to you Alex to make it true for you or do you want me to just give up on you and your family**  
* Why not  
* Okay well what do you want me to say to you that's truthful that will actually get you to take the action that you need to take  
* Do you really think that's the issue Alex  
* **So how much longer are you keep going to come up with excuses and lie to yourself instead of just facing the truth which is are you going to overcome your fear today yes or no**

# Fitness

Here are the questions and suggested questions attributed to Josh from the provided sources, formatted as a bulleted list:

* "Okay Got it So you mention your focus You lose that during the day You know you wake up with energy but it sounds like as the day goes on you have challenges with your emotional regulation stress levels and resilience Is that correct"

* so you mentioned by the end of the day there are things at your work where you don't have the emotional resilience Give me an example in the last couple weeks of something that happened 

* "What has been a specific example in the last few days or the last few weeks specific example"

* "i couldn't function for the rest of the day What does that mean or what happened"

* So at least where we're at now Alex it seems like this health issue is affecting three things your workouts so physical health your work which is your financial uh results and you're emotionally carrying this feeling of guilt around a lot of the time Is that accurate"

* when I summarized that you know you you seemed I don't really know the word for it Alex but quite um serious about that summary Why is that?""

* I'm curious Alex if it is affecting all areas of your life any particular reason you weren't aware of that 

  Okay How long have you been in denial about this"  
* "Okay Well if you've been in denial for two or three years did something change"  
* "Okay well why was that a turning point"  
* "Why not"

* what level is it at now that you're aware it's affecting all of your life what level is it now?"  
* So when you say it's it it's higher than before if you put it on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being you're fully aware that this is basically crippling all areas of your life zero being you know it can be denied What level are you at now"

* how long do you plan on your parents being at your house"  
* "Okay Well I mean after that what's the issue"  
* "How long do you plan on having your parents stay?""  
* "Okay When you say I mean are we talking another six weeks another six months another six years"  
* Well what comments are they making and what does he mean they don't they don't want to deal with him   
* what's the experience of living with your parents that don't want to deal with you"  
* "Okay When was the last time that happened"  
* "how often is that happening"  
* "how's that make you feel"  
* "how's it affecting you"  
* "And then and then we're pretty much at the point where we can start summarizing and then we need to get into a little bit more ownership and responsibility and why does he need a program But the summary to kind of start consolidating things is going to be how how much of an impact is it having on his workouts how much money has he lost in his job how is his day-to-day experience of being feeling guilty how is his day-to-day experience of living with his parents that don't want to deal with him and then you know stack that all up as making your case Okay so this has cost you two meetings a day for the last 52 weeks You know you've you've lost about 104 meetings How much do you earn a meeting if you close the deal"  
* "Okay And you know when when you are with your focus and you do have your emotional regulation down what's your close rate"  
* "How much do you make a deal"  
* "So you've you've not closed about 50 deals in the last year because of your focus fading by the end of the day and your resilience How much do you make a deal or $1,000 okay So you've lost $50,000 from this Is that accurate"  
* "Okay got it And the workouts like how's your health and fitness right now"  
* "Okay How's that affecting the other areas of your life"  
* got it $50,000 no more dates living with his parents having a shit life with his parents I'm curious Alex like was there any turning point with this experience more recently maybe in the last few days or few weeks where it became time to fix this"  
* "yes What happened"  
* "Okay Why did that make you realize you need to fix it"  
* "What do you need to fix it"  
* "Okay Why from us"  
* "How much longer tied down Done   
* So all you're doing now from this point is going a little bit deeper into a couple of the data points We need to know how much money he's losing at his job We need to know how not doing the workouts is actually affecting his health We need to know what his day-to-day experiences of his parents not wanting to deal with him And then once we've got the like tangible brass tack impacts of all of those things then we need to move into like tying it down in terms of why now and then that's it You like in the front part of the call when you're gathering data it can sometimes feel like you're opening a lot of open loops You're opening a lot of information and it it is going to feel overwhelming sometimes you're you're getting all of this information and you actually have to make it worse before you can make it better You have to go even deeper into all of those pieces of information and then go "Okay I've got the end result of the fitness the end result of the finances the end result of the emotional guilt and the end result of his parents living with him and not wanting to deal with him Now I've got the end result I can kind of clean my whiteboard of all of the the tertiary information that got us to those final points and just consolidate those final four points and say "Okay so it's this this this and this." As far as the impact is that accurate"

* "So I'm curious with it affecting you in these four ways at this level was there a turning point you had recently living with your parents them not wanting to deal with you maybe it's the workouts maybe it's the the work situation maybe it's the guilt Was there a turning point you had recently where you needed to fix this now"  
* "yes What was it"

* "Okay So we're always peeling back the layers So layer one we asked the opening question and he said my issues my challenges are losing focus by end end of date emotional regulation stress which is in emotional regulation and resilience Okay so that's layer one We g ot layer one Easy stuff The question you have to always ask yourself is so *so what* okay you have no focus by the end of the day You have no emotional regulation control You have stress You have resilience So What.  

  and *until the so equals price of your program you won't sell* It's that it's that simple"  
  **![][image1]**  
  **![][image2]**  
* "And so all you're doing in sales is by asking questions you're digging into the so what So what i'm losing focus by the end of the day my emotional regulation my stress So next thing that he said was two meetings per day workouts guilty That that was the next layer It's like okay you're missing two meetings a day you're missing your workouts and you feel guilty is is that is that you're going to give me money you're going to give me your time you're going to give me your effort you're going to give me your commitment you're going to give me your change of direction Fuck no Of course not They're not going to do that So we have to go even deeper Now then we get into living with parents They don't want to deal with me again It's like so like are you going to buy from me right now"  
* "two meetings per day Is that on average"  
* "How many workouts has he missed"  
* "What impact has that had on his health and fitness"  
* "what impact has his blank fitness failures had on the other impact of his life dot dot dot dot dot dating life most probably dating life social life back to work you know which is money and the these things can tie back together again because everything uh and this is a key thing for you to probably wri te down guys"  
* "So we've got dating life we've got you know his personal way he feels in the mirror we've got money We then want to tie it into you know what exactly happens at home when your parents quote unquote don't want to deal with you"  
* "How does that make you feel"  
* "right how long has it been like that"  
* "What else would we get"  
* "Is is that accurate"  
* "Okay I'm curious how much longer are you willing to pay these costs by not having dealt with your health and fitness like by that point the the seesaw is is pretty far tipped in this direction So all we're doing is going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper until until the things that we've got There is no longer a so what The the so what has disappeared It's it's so fucking obvious what the so what is that they're going to have to buy Now that's just the pain and the problem section of the sales call The other parts of the sales call that we still have to do is commitment plus ownership Why now like what was the slash turning point what was the actual tangible why now turning point"  
  **![][image3]**  
    
* Josh Weightskin I'm pretty sure it's called How to Learn And this guy has become like a champion He realized well if I put like 85 hours into this one tiny little section and I just put the other bits of my hours into that I'm now stacking the deck in my favor And he realized that for everything in life it's the same there is like a very small section of of whatever the task is you're doing that accounts for a massive amount of the results   
* So I say all of this to go back to what I was saying before which is in sales that section that you need to master guys and girls is this the pain slash the problem which also equals guys by the way the cost the opportunity cost of them not doing something about this right now   
* Do not try and master guys the why now the commitment or the ownership the the fucking solution section how how exactly do I do my how much longer question definitely don't fucking try and master objections or tonality or any of that BS Because if you want to master sales 95% of your sales success is going to come down to you just mastering how to go deeper and deeper into the pain and the problem And if you do that you're doing the uphill work and the downhill work is just really really really easy   
* two things are for asymmetrical returns in sales \= internal state \+ pain/problem

Based on the sources provided, the discussion about "the gap" occurs near the end of the transcript. Here is that section:

"Now before any of you say "Well I sell an offer that's not pain or problem." Pain or problem doesn't mean someone's going "Ouch." **Pain or problem means what is it costing them to continue having what they currently have in terms of solution or way of doing things versus what would they have if they had your way of doing things**. **That's what I mean by pain or problem**. **Some people call it the gap**. **If all you master is showing the gap of how much below par they currently are with what they're doing you will get asymmetrical returns in sales**."

# Addt Q’s

Here are segments from the source where Josh suggests questions or simulates dialogue as the salesperson in a role play:

* **what is the biggest challenge in blank right now** (when speaking to one person on a call with multiple prospects)  
* Jane in your opinion **what is the biggest challenge?** (when speaking to the other person on a call with multiple prospects)  
* hey **I noticed that when husband said this you may have had something else to add or something slightly different what was going on there** (when opinions slightly differ between prospects)  
* Jane **what's your opinion What do you think is the biggest change?** (when opinions are significantly different between prospects)  
* Okay so husband said this you said this **Why such a big difference between the two of you**  
* And I'll be curious about that **Why such a big difference between the two of you**  
* **How come when I ask this question you Mr Husband explain it very deeply But Jane when I ask you you don't really have much to say I'm curious** (when noticing a difference in how descriptive prospects are)  
* You would ask **Why is that** (follow-up to the previous observation)  
* Okay so **I noticed that you two are not you know in agreement with this.** How would you do blank tax reduction **If you're both disagreed how would you make a decision** (putting the problem back on misaligned prospects)

# Trading offer

Okay, here are excerpts from the transcript where Josh suggests questions or steps into the role of the salesperson during the roleplay session:

* **Okay so right now you are missing signals** just without saying the work  
* Well you still have to mention the work let me give you an example instead of saying you're not getting returns because of your work hours you could say **so the issue is you're not getting returns and a part of that could be because of the hours that you're working affecting you being able to trade at the right time** could be seems like might be  
* **Got it.** So you're trading and you're not getting the returns that you want and part of that problem could be that your working hours are affecting you missing signals **is that accurate**  
  * *yes part of that could be*  
* okay so Harrison right now you're not seeing return and that could potentially be given the fact that you're missing signals on your working hours  
  * *yeah that's correct*  
* What do you mean by trading life like what does that mean does that mean what t-shirt does he wear when he's trading does he wear one that says I love trading you know does he sit in front of a MacBook or a PC does he work in the dark does he work in with the lights on like **what what do you mean trading life what specifically are you trying to get out of him as far as information** are you trying to understand what has his returns been well then ask what were your returns last week or when you're saying trading life which I think by the sound of it is more what you were meaning are you meaning in the last week how many hours trading did you do and when did you do that trading and where did you do that trading and how did it go well then you're going to have to break that down into four or five different questions okay so okay you have to ask specifically what you want okay so Harrison you mentioned that right now you have no returns so over the last week did you get any returns at all **don't ask a yes or no question did you what were your returns** make the prospect have to think what were my returns don't just give them an answer where they can say yes or no  
* okay so Harrison over the last week **what has been your returns**  
  * *i think it's last two weeks it's been about honestly I'm down around 1,000 bucks the last two weeks*  
* last two weeks mhm okay so 2,000 bucks over the last two weeks and then over the last month **what has been your returns**  
  * *the last month last month total i'm this month I'm down 1,000 total i started off up a,000 but then lost two grand the last two weeks*  
* okay so you started you made 1K and then you lost 2K over the last two weeks okay got it **what was it that you've done to make those two this 1K at the start of the month**  
  * *well I just hit the signals earlier this month i got I'm I'm part of a Discord that calls out you know when's a good time to either call or put and I was able to get into the signals just fine didn't really focus on any huge returns just took consistent cash just aimed for about 20 25% even some days though just taking like 10 15% and it just was just consistent with that so I ended up being up arou*  
* okay so you were part of this Discord group with like all of the signals so you made 1K at the start of the month **what what stopped you from keep making money from the signals from that group**  
  * *well I was I was still I was still doing it but then work just got even busier for me and it's really just been the trend throughout not just this month but the past few months too where they're calling out signals they're usually earlier in the day but depending on how busy I am with work then I just may not be able to hit them and so I don't think it's necessarily they're calling out bad signals people are making returns on them it just doesn't feel like these are the calls that I'm able to make with my schedule*  
* m so with the first week that you made the 1K **what has your work schedule been looking like how many hours were you working a day**  
  * *it's been it's been the same it's been around I work from like I work from 9:00 to 5:30 Monday through Friday*  
* okay so you said it's been the same is it the same as it is now  
  * *yeah it's the same the only thing that changes is that I work on sales so it depends on how many inbound meetings I get in a given week you know some weeks it'll be maybe I'm getting them first thing in the morning i usually don't take calls until around 9:30 which I wish I could change but unfortunately that's when the market's open and so it really just depends more on not like the time of day I'm working but what meetings I have during those days because when I'm on a call I I can't look at the I can't look at the charts at all*  
* what's your plan to what's your plan going forward with trading given the fact that your workload has been you know going higher  
* if this method of trading is not working for you what do you think would  
* what are you going to be able to do to trade and get the signals similar to as far as a plan do you know  
* do you know any other ways to trade  
* how are you planning to be successful in trading with your current  
* okay got it so you mentioned that your your hours could be affecting you being able to trade on the signals and therefore you're getting inconsistent and very limited results **how then are you planning to be successful in trading with your current work schedule**  
* hey okay Harrison so you mentioned your schedule could be the reason that you're having inconsistent and very limited results **do you know any traders that have a work schedule similar to yours that are getting the results that you want**  
  * *yeah actually a buddy of mine who works at the same company he's in the same Discord and he's making profits every single week on there so I think I mean I've seen I've seen him do it so I know it's possible*  
* so **what do you think is different to him getting the results that you want versus you**  
  * *i think it's really his schedule i think he's got the he works the same hours but the big thing is like when we take meetings and he doesn't take meetings until 10 usually which for us the call outs are usually at 9:30 as soon as market opens so*  
* okay well let's let's go back then i mean someone that does have the same availability as far as hours to you **do you think there's anyone out there that has the same availability as you as far as when they can trade and when they can't that has got the results that you want**  
  * *i mean yeah I'd say so*  
* any any other ways that there are people out there that are getting the results that you want with the same schedule  
  * *i think like no they could theoretically I know I focus so much during during the morning but I could still take trades maybe midday or at the end of the day which I know people do i haven't done that though just cuz that's not when the call outs really are and I know that requires more chart reading which I don't feel like I've got the time for makes total sense*  
* so it sounds like as far as you getting becoming successful as a trader and correct me if I'm wrong it sounds like you have two options **option one is you change your work schedule and you maintain following the current call outs and the current signals and therefore you'd have more consistency or option two is you need to learn a different style of trading whilst maintaining your current schedule which one of those is more preferable**  
  * *learning a different style i don't have I don't have much control over my schedule in terms of meetings I take and if anything I I'm in sales so I want to keep meetings open so that way I can still be making you know still be bringing in commission in the job that I am in right now so I'd say the second one*  
* okay i I actually missed an option so let's just go back **option three is you could just not trade**  
  * *i don't want to not trade*  
* okay so between the option of not trying to make money with trading changing your schedule to be more consistent and successful with your current strategy or learning a completely new strategy that would allow you to trade successfully in the middle or the end of the days **that third option sounds like that's the most preferable**  
  * *okay*  
* okay so Harrison you mentioned a couple of things you also mentioned you are your job right now is you do sales right and so you work on commission **why don't you just put more hours into that and make more money with that**  
* okay so you're you're in sales you're making commissions **when did you get into trading**  
  * *oh that was 6 months ago*  
* okay **why why did you get into trading**  
* okay so Harrison you mentioned you do sales **how long have you been doing sales for**  
  * *sales I've been in this company for now two years*  
* two years and **when was it that you started with trading**  
  * *i've always invested in stocks but trading I'd say about four months ago*  
* four months ago okay **what happened four months ago that made you want to get into trading**  
* okay so you're a salesperson you did you've been doing that for 2 ye ars just over a year and a half into sales you then got into trading **what happened**  
  * *well you know I I kind of been doing sales for a year and a half i was pretty burned out i thought you know I don't really want to be doing this forever i I need to get out of it*  
* okay **was there something specific that happened a year and a half in as far as the burnout**  
  * *yeah like I' I'd gone from making 20K a month all the way back down to five*  
* okay i mean maybe a redundant question Harrison but you you could have just doubled back down on sales and studied harder or invested the money you've put into trading to do that **why didn't you do that**  
  * *no honestly I just I I know I don't want to be in sales for the rest of my life*  
* okay cool **what is it about trading that makes you feel that is what you want to do at least for the the imminent future versus sales**  
* it sounds like when you saw that from your friend that was a pretty mind-blowing realization for you **is that accurate**  
  * *oh yeah man it was accurate because of this and this and this and this and this and this and this*  
* **why** when we were talking about that or when you were talking about that did you have this reaction  
* so Harrison when you told the story about your friend and how we showed you like how much money he's making I noticed um excitement when you were talking about it **why is that**  
  * *i mean yeah just seeing him like he we're we're both at the same job like I'm I'm a leg above him like I got promoted but we have the same hours and the same schedule and as soon as he showed me that I was like what am I doing right now like I could be making this much money just sitting at my desk at this point i want to hop right into it and so that's why I got all in cuz like it just feels like I could be making this much more money right now in this quicker time like at this point like if I can keep this up get good at this then this would be golden for the future*  
* okay and so you thought to yourself you know what am I doing because you guys are both at the same job and he's like making much more money **trying to t** **hink what question to ask right now**  
* okay so you had that conversation 6 months ago you've been trying to figure it out you've been very inconsistent with your returns and you've had very limited returns **has something shifted again that you're now reaching out for help**  
* so like **what was it about him telling you that story that made you feel like that**  
* I would I would probably phrase it as okay so your buddy is in fact I need more data like **do you know how much money your friend is making in trading**  
  * *oh he's making $20,000 a month*  
* and **how much did you make last month in commissions**  
  * *oh he made uh I made $5,000*  
* and **is he making commissions as well**  
  * *yes*  
* **how much did he make**  
  * *5,000*  
* so you both make the same commissions 5 grand but he's making an extra $20,000 a month more than you from trading **what is it about that additional money that has been mind-blowing for you in terms of your reality**  
* so I would get my little calculator out and I go "So he made $5,000 in commissions $5,000 divided by 30 days so you're making $160 a day and your friend is having $5,000 days."  
* okay got it so 5,000 divide by 30 days so you're you're making 160 bucks a day and your friend that has got trading working for him is making $5,000 a day some days **is that accurate**  
  * *yes*  
* when you hear the difference in how much he' s making per day versus you **how does that make you feel**  
* **why does it make you feel that way**  
  * *well because you know life's short time's precious*  
* so let me ask you **what do you think you need to and then another thing I would do is I would then take those two numbers so I'd say 5,000 divided by 166 so he's making 30x more than you per day**  
* so **what do you think you need to uh 30x your income**  
  * *i need training i need mentorship i need a coach*  
* Okay got it We've been trying to do this on your own for the last four months **why now**  
  * *well because my I'm sick and tired that my buddy's making 30 times more than me a day*  
* okay **was there a turning point when you decided to reach out**  
  * *yes*  
* **what happened**  
  * *my buddy just gave in his notice*  
* so your buddy's been making 30 times more than you a day he's had $5,000 a day while you're going to work making $166 and two weeks ago he handed in his 30-day notice **how does this make you feel that this is your reality and you have a very close friend of yours that is living a completely different reality**  
  * *i feel terrible*  
* **how much longer are you willing to stay living this reality**  
* **how much longer are you going to continue not figuring it out without the training without the mentorship without the community knowing that in two weeks your buddy is probably with with all respect Harrison barely going to see you anymore because he's going to leave the job and he's going to go living his life making 30 times more money than you do you want to be left behind**  
  * *no*  
* **why not**  
* **how do you feel that 166 number** as soon as you said that I was like damn yeah that was that was it i feel like that was really what was missing is like I honestly it was it was pure excitement but then you making me realize that that's when I literally felt my chest dropped i'm like like that's when I was like "Yeah I really got to change something."  
* okay so what do you do for work  
* and and how long have you been doing it for  
* and when did you get into trading  
* why why did you get into trading  
* what about that was not spoton or what about that was not accurate  
* How do you feel  
* Why now  
* What was the turning point  
* How much longer  
* When did you last go on vacation  
* How was that vacation  
* so you haven't been on a vacation in the last 2 years **has something shifted that that's no longer the way you're willing to live**  
  * *yes*  
* **what shifted**  
* where have you wanted to travel  
* okay **has there been somewhere that you've wanted to travel to recently that you didn't get to travel to because of money**  
  * *yes*  
* **where was it**  
* **why did you want to go there**  
* **how did it when when you were wanting to go there how far did you get into the process of planning that trip**  
  * *oh well we didn't even we didn't even do a a Google search for a hotel booking*  
* **why**  
  * *because we're too poor*  
* **how does that make you feel**  
* **how did that make you feel to want to go to that place and not be able to go there**  
* why do you want to do the once in a-lifetime experience  
* if nothing has changed and it hasn't been accomplished thus far **how do you think you're going to accomplish it with the same level of motivation and commitment that you've had for the last 3 years**  
* do you think part of the problem in regards to why you haven't accomplished this has been that it's just been a nice to have  
* has something changed in regards to the level of importance of you accomplishing this now  
* so where do you want to go from here  
* has something shifted  
* what's going on right now  
* how about now  
* has or did anything change  
* What's the biggest reason you want to get into ecom right now  
* has something shifted

* how much money do you think you need to to jump into that  
* okay what do you have right now for assets  
* do you want to include vehicles and stuff like that as far as this  
* what do we have for investments aside from just land and the contract roth uh i do have a roth ira i started it and he got out and we kind of as far as this  
* you've had this roth that's been sitting for five years but there's only $12 in it  
* you mentioned you want to retire early  
* so what do you feel is holding you back  
* how much do you earn a year from that right now  
* and so then on a monthly basis you know after you've just paid your taxes how much you left with on a monthly basis  
* and then what are your monthly expenses  
* so you got $1,800 over the last three months that $1,800 a month how much of that have you been left with like you haven't just spent it on other things  
* so none  
* what did you spend $5,400 on in the last 90 days  
* h how much of that $1,800 a month would you say you spend on your kids on a monthly basis  
* how much are you spending on a monthly basis on your kids just for fun or toys  
* are you spending the other $1,300 a month on on guns  
* where's that going  
* if you're being honest with yourself how well spent would you say that $22,800 has been in regards to you being able to retire early  
* you being able to potentially run the tactical business and just you simply having the financial future that you want to have  
* if you were to put it on a scale of one to 10  
* where would you put it  
* is that fair to say  
* would you agree with that  
* do you want to change that number  
* how many years have you not been budgeting your money and things have been basically the same as far as the way that you're spending money  
* how much do you think you're overspending on a monthly basis if you could ballpark it  
* how many years have you been overspending a,000 a month  
* okay and right now what are we bringing in after taxes per month  
* what are our ballpark monthly fixed expenses  
* what are your bills per month  
* investments right now  
* do you not have a you were in the marines don't you have something in what way  
* how how is having $1,000 of extra guns and ammo every month going to play off in the long run  
* do you need to keep spending a thousand a month  
* like what are you planning on having a fucking zombie apocalypse  
* how much is that tractor worth ballpark  
* what's holding you back from paying this off  
* what does your wife think about all this  
* my question to you why is it so important that you actually retire early  
* as opposed to asking why is it important in the future we want to ask why now is he making a change in the present  
* has some has something shifted as opposed to why in the future do you want to retire 15 years early  
* why today are you no longer satisfied with continuing the way you've currently been managing your money  
* why is this desire for retiring earlier in the future why is that something different now that you're actually if you are committed to making some very significant changes in how you manage your money the help you receive to manage your money and basically how you're going to live your life in the present no more buying $4,000 rifles  
* why do you think that hasn't happened  
* okay was there something that shifted now as to never wanting to work for the man  
* what changed  
* why now  
* what are those right moves  
* why haven't you made them  
* what is different now  
* so for 5 years you've spent all of this money having wanted to have a tactical training business what is different now  
* how long have they been in the situation that they don't like so that i can then tie the timeline to how the experience has been being in that situation for that period of time  
* how many years have you wanted to work for yourself to you know drink your morning coffee go down to the range do the training and not be going into the department of justice  
* how has that impacted you in the other areas of your life  
* so then what i'm curious chris is are you at the point where you're no longer willing to live another day living that reality  
* okay got it so i'm i'm clear on where we're at currently mr prospect you've got $22,500 negative net you know what do they call it your your net worth  
* why if you are are you now willing to actually follow a budget and to actually get the help with writing the budget and sticking to the budget when that's completely the opposite of what you've been doing for the last 5 years  
* i'm just asking you make good money you have $5,800 $800 margin and it seems like you want to start your own business i don't think there's any reason why you couldn't but you mentioned over the last two years you've done nothing but start a budget that is not consistent right you've put $12 away to your investments  
* my question to you is are you willing to accept the way that you've been managing your money  
* are you willing to make changes necessary so you can actually get out of this job and actually start your business and live a life worth of meaning a purpose  
* have you reached that point  
* what would you need specifically from a mentor like budget dog to actually start being consistent with the budget  
* no no no why do you think why if you do are you now at the point when you want to work with a fitness trainer  
* okay got it  
* what was it specifically that attracted you to chris as the fitness trainer that you want to work with  
* does that make sense  
* okay got it so you tried to follow a budget on your own hasn't worked what do you think you need to be able to follow budget oh  
* what about with the budget you mentioned you haven't been able to stick to a budget what do you think you need from a coach or mentor to actually make you stick to that  
* you want to just think about it  
* do you feel you know stopped you like from sticking to  
* do you feel like accountability would help you guys stick to it  
* okay cool let's just say you had accountability you had the structure you knew exactly where to invest how much do you think knowing that you have a $5,800 margin per month how much would you be able to put towards your investment on a monthly basis to be aggressive with this so we can get you out of this 9 to5 as soon as possible  
* let's say he says i know it's not the right numbers but let's say he said 10,000 which is more than he has but just to play my numbers we could then say that within 12 months he would have 120,000 to build his tactical training business okay but it's hypothetical future it's so much more powerful to say as as i demonstrated before he's already spent 80,000 which would have actually probably been 160,000 in other words if you show someone the facts that they've already spent the money then basically what you're showing them with absolute unquestionable proof is if you stop doing the bad actions that you're doing you will have that money whereas when you try saying okay how much can you put aside you know how many months would it be to have the tactical business blah blah blah everything is in the future which means people s  
* now let me ask you this knowing that you wouldn't have to work any harder you wouldn't have to work any more hours you would have you would have an additional 573,000 in the next 10 years for business what would that mean for you

Here are the questions suggested or asked by Josh:

* So you're currently a barber and when you say you're currently a barber like what is the arrangement you have being a barber in regards to do you work as an employee for someone else do you rent someone else's space what's your current situation?  
* What was it last month?  
* What was it the month before?  
* What was it the month before?  
* You said that's a bad month how was last month?  
* What is your average price per haircut?  
* How many haircuts did you do?  
* How many clients do you have?  
* Does he have any other expenses?  
* What are those expenses per month?  
* If you do this many haircuts a day let's say he says five how many hours would you say you're actually out of the house working?  
* How much he's charging on average per cut?  
* How many cuts he's doing per week?  
* How many clients he's got on his like book of business?  
* The income?  
* His expenses?  
* The hours that he's working per week?  
* How many other chairs are in the barber shop?  
* How's it going?  
* Okay got it so you're a barber right now when you say you're a barber what is kind of the setup for you as far as barbering like are you in someone else's shop like what's your setup?  
* Yeah that was exactly what I meant so you're renting a chair weekly from a friend of yours how much do you pay a week?  
* Okay got it so you're paying $1,000 a month okay and how long have you been renting that chair on the Homeboy discount in the shop?  
* And last week how many haircuts if you were to ballpark the number did you actually cut?  
* Was that was that a good week was that a bad week was that an average week?  
* What is it on average if you looked back at the last three months on a week-to-week basis how many cuts are you doing per week on average like if you balanced out a good and a bad week where would it kind of sit in the middle?  
* How many days a week?  
* And how much do you charge per cut now I know you probably have different prices so again if we took kind of an average order value per cut so not the cheapest not the most expensive but if we kind of said a middle ground for each of those 15 cuts you're doing a week what is kind of the average that you're charging?  
* So how much did you make in total last month income not profit but just income?  
* What about the month before?  
* And one more month before that?  
* And I don't know if barbering is seasonal if you looked at that quarter compared to the quarter before or any other quarter over the last 12 months is that is that an average quarter or was this a good quarter or was this a bad quarter?  
* And then you mentioned that you have clients that are some consistent clients of these average three cuts a day that you do per day what would you say is the percentage of recurring clients versus new clients how many are people that you've already been cutting hair for for a while what percentage would you give that?  
* And where do your clients come from that are new how do they find out about you and find out about the shop and specifically choose to get their haircut in your chair?  
* Is there any other ways that they would find out about you aside from your reels?  
* And when you say walk-ins you mean that someone's just walking past the shop and they see oh it's a barber shop and I need a haircut?  
* Is it like a very busy street or is it like what kind of rate would you give walk-ins is that like oh shit man we have we're on a highway and everybody drives past or walks past or like well it's not really a lot of people where would you kind of put that?  
* If you were to guess and I know it's kind of a guess so it's a bit intuitive of the 50% of your clients that are new clients how many of them would you say have just walked past the shop and just happened to coincidentally walk past versus how many people you attracted from your social media?  
* If you put a percentage on that?  
* Where's the other 20 or 30% coming from?  
* If someone walks in if someone just walked into the shop and they were going to get their haircut with someone else in the shop but that person was busy so then they decided to go and get their haircut with you do you still earn the same amount of money?  
* And the other thing I wanted to know is how long total have you been a barber like actually earning money as a barber?  
* And how long has it been since you've been with this type of setup where you're renting a chair maybe it was someone else's chair that you're renting but how long have you had this type of arrangement as a business where you rent someone else's chair and you pay to rent it?  
* And how has that changed over the last five years or has it basically been like that for five years has that gone up recently has it gone down?  
* You mean like from like new ones and some that just continuously the same face that you see every time would you say "Oh there's 20 guys and girls that I always cut their hair on."?  
* How many followers have you got on IG at the moment?  
* And how did you get those 800 is that just organic or have you paid for adverts or?  
* And over what time period did you go from 0 to 800?  
* And is that growth about the same now so you're growing about 250 a year 250 people a year?  
* How long have you been thinking about that?  
* How long was a while like three years?  
* So you were a barber for 5 years and two years into barbering renting someone else's chair you started to think about going on your own why did you start thinking about that rather than just keep renting a chair?  
* What do you mean when you say it triggered you?  
* Has something shifted as far as you actually being willing to face that fear so that you can be cashing out?  
* Why what happened why was that such a significant thing for you?  
* Do you know how much more money facing this fear is going to cash out for you?  
* Do you know roughly how much your homeboy is making?  
* When you hear that number how does that number sound to you?  
* So how much longer are you going to flush away half a million dollars every 3 years because you don't face what's scary for you?  
* Are you going to go another day losing that money in the next 30 days?  
* Is it fair to say Jesus that you're putting money away because it's a procrastination of just facing your fear you're telling yourself you're doing something good and you're doing something noble by saving money but what is the real reason that you're not cashing out?  
* How much longer are you going to tell yourself the rationalization that you need to put more money away as opposed to actually invest money to be able to get your own clients consistently so that you feel comfortable to open up the shop and pay the rent month-to-month so you can then be the one making the real money?

Here are the questions suggested or asked by Josh:

* Does that make all of that sense?  
* Now I might be missing a piece of understanding about the barber industry but what I kind of assumed maybe wrongly is that Jesus is working in someone else's shop and so does it matter how many clients he has at someone else's shop because is it not the owner of the barber shop that owns those clients in other words he he basically has zero clients because none of them are his own clients or is that incorrect as far as the barber industry?  
* Does that make sense?  
* Does that make sense?  
* So you're currently a barber and when you say you're currently a barber like what is the arrangement you have being a barber in regards to do you work as an employee for someone else do you rent someone else's space h what's your current situation?  
* Does that make sense?  
* Make sense?  
* Ready?  
* What do you mean by by what's what what's my setup?  
* How much do you pay a week?  
* And how long have you been renting that chair on the Homeboy discount in the shop?  
* And last week how many haircuts if you were to ballpark the number did you actually cut?  
* Was that was that a good week was that a bad week was that an average week?  
* So if that's a good week what is it on average if you looked back at the last three months on a week- toeek toeek basis how many cuts are you doing per week on average like if you balanced out a good and a bad week where would it kind of sit in the middle?  
* And how many days a week?  
* And how much do you charge per cut?  
* So how much did you make in total last month income not not profit but just income?  
* What about the month before?  
* And one more month before that?  
* And I don't know if barbering is seasonal if you looked at that quarter compared to the quarter before or any other quarter over the last 12 months is that is that an average quarter or was this a good quarter or was this a bad quarter?  
* Of these uh average three cuts a day that you do per day what would you say is the percentage of recurring clients versus new clients how many are people that you've already been cutting hair for for a while what percentage would you give that?  
* And where do your clients come from that are new how do they find out about you and find out about the shop and specifically choose to get their haircut in your chair?  
* Is there any other ways that they would find out about you aside from your reels?  
* And when you say walk-ins you mean that someone's just walking past the shop and they see oh it's a barber shop and I need a haircut?  
* If you if you were to guess and I know it's kind of a guess so it's a bit intuitive of the 50% of your clients that are new clients how many of them would you say have just walked past the shop and just happened to coincidentally walk past versus how many people you attracted from your social media if you put a percentage on that?  
* So that was 20% plus 50% where where's the other 20 or 30% coming from?  
* If someone if someone walks in and then they decide that they were going to have a haircut with someone else but that person was busy do you still get the full $40?  
* Say that one more time?  
* Do you still earn the same amount of money?  
* And the other thing I wanted to know is how long total have you been a barber like actually earning money as a barber?  
* And how long uh how long has it been since you've been with this type of setup where you're renting a chair maybe it was someone else's chair that you're renting but how long have you had this type of arrangement as a as a business where you rent someone else's chair and you pay to rent it?  
* Pretty much for the entire 5 years when you started cutting professionally you've just found a chair rented a chair and then kind of had a combination of walk-ins building your social media and that's kind of what you've been doing for the last 5 years?  
* Do you have any other expenses per month aside from renting the chair and what what is that total per month?  
* Not your personal expenses like your profit as a barber?  
* And h how has that changed over the last five years or has it basically been like that for five years has that gone up recently has it gone down?  
* How many clients would you say you've got recurring total at the moment like recurring book of business clients?  
* So you got about 35 recurring clients you said you're doing 15 a week 15 cuts 50% of those are new people and 50% are recurring?  
* Of those seven or eight new people about half of that come from your IG how many followers have you got on IG at the moment?  
* And how did you get those 800 is that just organic or have you paid for adverts or?  
* And over what time period did you go from 0 to 800?  
* And is that growth about the same now so you're go you're growing about 250 a year 250 people a year?  
* How long have you been thinking about that?  
* How long was a while?  
* So you were a barber for 5 years and two years into barbering renting someone else's chair you started to think about going on your own why did you start thinking about that rather than just keep renting a chair?  
* What do you mean when you say it triggered you?  
* Does that make sense everyone?  
* Why aren't you?  
* Has something shifted as far as you actually being willing to face that fear so that you can be cashing out?  
* Why what happened?  
* Why was that such a significant thing for you?  
* Do you know how much more money facing this fear is going to cash out for you?  
* Do you know roughly how much your homeboy is making?  
* When you hear that number how does that number sound to you?  
* So how much longer are you going to flush away half a million dollars every 3 years because you don't face what's scary for you?  
* Are you going to go another day losing that money in the next 30 days Jesus?  
* What is the strategic shift that he needs to make to not lose another 15,000 in the next 30 days?  
* Put it in the chat guys what is the shift?  
* Is it fair to say Jesus that you're putting money away because it's a procrastination of just facing your fear?  
* How much longer are you going to tell yourself the rationalization that you need to put more money away as opposed to actually invest money to be able to get your own clients consistently so that you feel comfortable to open up the shop and pay the rent month to month so you can then be the one making the real money?  
* Does that make sense?  
* Why us?  
* Does that make sense everyone?  
* Put in the chat if anybody's confused?  
* Okay is this making sense to everybody?  
* Does that make sense?  
* Why trading or why us are you saying it's even unnecessary because they already know why us and why trading?  
* Does that make sense?

* You earned the $50,000 four months ago and haven't generated a single dollar going through 200,000 people in the last four months, is that accurate?

* You've made $8,000 from 50,000 followers?  
* You made like you know, 10 cents per follower?  
* You've made $8,000 over the past four months from your audience of 50,000 followers, and if you do the math there you've made about 16 cents per follower over the past four months?  
* How does it sound?  
* How do you feel?  
* How many followers have your friends got that are making 10 to 15K?  
* Any particular reason that number is a first goal, does that signify anything to you?  
* If you actually accomplish that, what would that allow you to do in your personal life?  
* Is that a goal of yours?  
* Why not?

* What happened in your life six months ago?  
* But it doesn't seem like that opportunity to make $3,000 in a couple of hours was enough at that time to pull you out of your current way of living your current life, did something then shift as far as your life and your lifestyle and what was going on in your life that then you are now seeing this opportunity and wanting to capitalize on it, does that make sense?  
* Why did that then shift things for you?  
* Why money?  
* When she then broke up with you and you realized that, what were the thoughts that were going through your head?  
* Not comfortable with what?

* I'm getting the sense that whatever was happening in your life, you didn't have that drive to just really focus on the personal brand at that moment, is that accurate?  
* I'm getting the sense that something shifted in your life 6 months ago that you've reoriented yourself back to this make money opportunity as a focus point, is that accurate?  
* I'm getting the sense that six months ago something shifted in your life where you decided to actually start to focus on the opportunity around your personal brand, is that accurate?  
* Where is your family right now?  
* A friend of yours had the same opportunity that you had 6 months ago to be making multiple thousands of dollars in a couple of hours, and he capitalized on it and over the six months he built money, built money, built money, and was able to then do that experience with his parents, meanwhile you had basically just turned a blind eye to that opportunity, is that accurate?  
* Is that accurate?  
* How does that make you feel?  
* Where is your family?  
* Why has your friend been able to do that and you didn't?  
* So what would have changed that course of time so that you got the result that your friend got?  
* What Fernando, what could you have done 6 months before that to have actually capitalized on that opportunity and been in a position where you were making you know 10, 15K a month?  
* What was the difference, what was the difference in the actions that you took versus your friend that led to him having this desired result?  
* What was the difference between your friend and you over the last 6 months that meant he got that result and you didn't?  
* What was the difference?  
* What is different?  
* What was the difference between the actions that he took in terms of capitalizing on a personal brand and the actions that you took?  
* Do you think your friend got that result of 10 to 15 grand, taking his parents, by doing the same one month of posting as you?  
* Your friend put twice as much effort in as you, how much do you think that double amount of effort led to a significantly different result?  
* You did the one month of consistent effort, how much effort and time do you think your friend put in to be able to get the result of making the 10 to 15K a month, of being able to bring his parents to the United States?  
* Why are we on this call?  
* How do you put luck on your side?  
* Is that luck?  
* If you were to kind of split out that combination, how much do you think results are based on luck and how much do you think it's based on mentorship, training, strategy, execution, things like that, things that are in your control?  
* 80% of the results that you want to get now is in your control, 20% we could debate is luck, is that what you're saying?  
* Do you think it was luck with your friend?  
* What about you?  
* What do you want to play with?  
* What are the things that you think would put luck on your side?  
* To what extreme do you think that's going to put luck on your side?  
* What do you think was the difference between the efforts and the inputs that your friend put in that resulted in him making the 10 to 15K a month and him being able to bring his parents to the United States, what was the difference between what he did and what you did?  
* What did your friend do over the last 6 months that got him those results?  
* What was different over the last 6 months between your friend and you that meant he got the result of 15 grand and taking his parents on that trip, what was the difference between your friend and you?  
* What was the difference between what your friend did that resulted in him making the 10 to 15K and bringing his parents to the United States versus what you did over that six-month period?

* How much money do you have in savings?  
* Did your friend just quit his job on day one?  
* How long over the six months was it that your friend still had his job?  
* Your friend was in the same situation as you for 4 months, so what was the difference?  
* What I'm noticing, as far as the reason that your friend is so much further ahead than you of making all this money providing that to his family, is when we dig into the reasons you're rationalizing a lot what those reasons are, why do you think that is?  
* Why, when it's so obvious that you and your friend literally had the same opportunity for the last 4 months, do you find it difficult to be honest about that?  
* So why, if it is, is that situation enough for you to break your own lies and excuses and rationalizations?  
* Did your friend just quit his job day one?  
* What was the difference between that and what you did?  
* Why didn't you?  
* Why didn't you spend those first two months going all in on maintaining your job whilst actually capitalizing on this opportunity to get ahead?  
* He decided to spend two months managing his job whilst also putting in the time and effort required so that eight weeks later he could actually quit his job, is that accurate?  
* Can I be direct?  
* Has something shifted?  
* Why didn't you?  
* Has something shifted recently where you now are focused on making this a reality for you?  
* But you saw the family get here 6 months ago, so what are you talking about?

* Are you at the point where you're no longer willing to not be focused and to not put in the work and the effort and not be able to manage your job while working on your personal brand so that you can actually make money and bring your family over here?  
* Why?  
* Can I challenge you on that, when you say not be able to, correct me if I'm wrong, do you mean that you didn't work hard enough to make that happen?  
* Is that right or is that not right, or is there something else that you want to add in there, because it sounded like you'd come to the realization when you saw your friend's parents in front of you that you wish you'd worked harder so that your parents were stood in front of you?  
* How hard are you going to work now to make sure that the next opportunity that comes around, it's not you looking at your friend's parents in the eyes, it's you looking in your own parents' eyes?  
* Are you saying that over the past year or so you haven't been able to bring them over, or you weren't able, or you weren't willing to work hard enough and put enough focus in to actually being able to bring them over?

* Why do you want to do personal branding with us?  
* What are the things that you know you need to work harder on?

* What do you need to work harder on so that within the next 6 months you can have your parents stood in front of you because you made 10 to 15 grand?  
* What do you need to work harder on so that within the next 6 months you can make 10 to 15K and bring your parents over here to the States?  
* You need more quality, you need more consistency, you need more conversions into sales and brand deals, what do you think is?

* What does that mean?  
* What do you mean by everything that he does?  
* You're seeing Lucas execute a system with speed that gets results, and you just want a part of that now?  
* Which was something he told you he was going to accomplish, and you just thought 'Yeah whatever.' And then when his parents were in front of you, you were like 'Oh shit, I didn't work hard enough on the same opportunity that we both had.' Is that all accurate?  
* You basically want to work with Lucas because you've seen him getting the results that your friend got that you want for you, so that you could make 10-15K, get out of your bartending job, and actually 6 months from now you'll be texting me saying 'Hey dude, I'm here with my parents, we made this happen.' Is that accurate?  
* How many more days are you willing to not work hard enough to have your parents in front of you?  
* How many more days do you not want to work hard enough so that to get your parents in front of you?  
* Fernando, how many more days are you not willing to put in the hard work so that the result is you can be looking at your parents in the eyes 6 months from now?

# Trading Offer

Here are the questions suggested by Josh or where he played the salesperson in the roleplay:

* In your opinion what is the biggest challenge with blank?  
* In your opinion what is the biggest challenge that you're having with blank?  
* And based on the fact that you're getting that intuition from YouTube and from just whatever's happening in the moment how do you feel about that strategy?  
* How do you feel about that strategy?  
* Why do you think you got those results?  
* Okay Intuition from what?  
* How do you feel about that?  
* How many hours are you spending on a weekly basis?  
* Given that you're watching YouTube videos and you're reading the charts and you're saying that you're intuitively you know guessing what to do why are you not confident?  
* Why is that?  
* Why are you not confident with your intuition that is coming from watching free content on YouTube and just reading the charts?  
* So I'm curious was there something that shifted recently as a as in regards to no longer wanting to rely on free YouTube content Discord groups that you're currently in and your attempts to read the charts?  
* How many times per week is that?  
* And what are you doing during those four hours?  
* What about studying what about watching YouTube what about learning how to read charts?  
* And when do you watch the YouTube videos to develop your intuitive ability and learn to read charts?  
* And what about at the weekends?  
* Is that Saturday and Sunday?  
* What about the Discord as well?  
* How many hours do you spend viewing Discord watching free YouTube and learning to read charts?  
* How how long have you been have you been running the same approach?  
* So when did you start trading?  
* How much do you make in your day job?  
* When you hear that number how do you feel?  
* Why do you feel that's ridiculous?  
* So why have you continued trading knowing how much time you're putting in and how little money you're making and following an approach that you're not confident with?  
* Why hasn't it happened for you?  
* Have you gotten to the point where you're no longer willing to follow a ridiculous approach?  
* Why why now what was that turning point you've been doing this for 6 months Was there a recent turning point?  
* Did you not have an intuition?  
* So given that your entire approach to trading is intuitive but you're not intuitively able to see the lack of results that you're getting for so much time how do you feel about your intuitive abilities?  
* How much longer do you want intuition to be your approach?  
* Why did you get into trading?  
* How accurate do you think your intuition has been?  
* So given the fact that you've spent 864 hours over the last 6 months and you've only been making $50 an hour and you didn't have an intuitive read that things weren't working How do you feel about your intuition being your approach?  
* How much longer do you want to rely on that intuition?  
* When did you come to that realization?  
* So was there was there a turning point where you realized my intuition isn't going to get me to where I want to go and I'm going to book a call and get help?  
* Was there a moment that you realize something needs to change what was that moment?  
* I don't know What do you think?  
* What happened you just looked at the calendar and was like 'Oh it's been 6 months.'?  
* What exactly happened Zion you you got to June and had been counting the months and were like 'Oh no 6 months Can't go past that.' Or or what actually happened?  
* So what exactly shifted for you you know to got you to book a call in the first place?  
* Was it something that happened in the real estate side of things that then prompted you to get more serious with the trading and have a new approach or was it something going on with your trading that because that is the vehicle you want to use to get out of your real estate that that was a shift?  
* I'm not quite understanding Z was there something that happened in the real estate or something that happened in the trading that prompted you to realize 6 months only making $50 a month on average your approach of intuition from YouTube isn't going to get you what you want?  
* Was there a turning point when you realized your approach intuition from YouTube and Discord and you know reading the charts yourself wasn't going to get you where you wanted?  
* What prompted you to book in a call to get outside help?  
* So you're saying that having not made any money for the last 6 months you hadn't had any realization until you booked in this call Is that accurate?  
* So I understand you spent 6 months using an intuitive approach that was watching free content on YouTube reading charts yourself and following a Discord group $864 hours spent later you've only made $300 Is that accurate?  
* So what was the turning point?  
* What was the turning point it definitely wasn't The calendar went from month five to month six That's not the turning point.  
* So did you have a point this month where you where you went down pretty badly What was that what happened there?  
* How much money did you lose that day?  
* How did that compare to previous losses?  
* So why did having a loss that was 10 times larger than any loss you've made before change something for you?  
* So what?  
* What was the issue with losing $2,000 in a day?  
* Why was losing that $2,000 recently on month six why was that a turning point?  
* And so realizing that that $2,000 was the difference between you being able to quit your job and your monthly income as a realtor When you lost that amount of money and saw it come out in a single day knowing what that means to you how did that make you feel?  
* So if I'm understanding clearly Zion you've been doing this for the last 6 months You spent $864 hours You've only made $300 total which was actually month after month loss loss loss and then recently you had a little bit of money But the turning point for you in regards to your approach which has previously been intuition from free content on YouTube Discord and trying to read the charts on your own Um the turning point was when the amount of money that you lost in a single moment was the same amount of money that would get you out of your real estate job That was the turning point for you where you realized this can be everything or it can be nothing And the difference is I need a different approach Is that accurate?  
* So let me ask you now you know that you need a different approach and you know you need it now because you've had that awakening moment with the $2,000 What different approach do you think you need?  
* Okay why?  
* Why us?  
* So let me ask you Zion how much longer do you not want to have this approach this approach and this approach and instead be following your intuition from YouTube and from free content and Discord and reading charts knowing that the difference between these two approaches you've now realized is the difference between you having to stay in real estate or you having those $2,000 days or $2,000 monthly income where you could get out of real estate How much longer do you want to be on the wrong side of those different approaches?  
* Okay so what I'm wondering Don is we've gone through what we've got going on over here We've gone through your situation We had a chat about or had a discussion about what changes you need to make You're now clear of what we do over here I'm very confused why before you even know the investment and all those details of how we process that you're already telling me reasons that you couldn't make a decision?  
* How many times have you done that what does it cost you?  
* Shall Shall we just leave this call here then if you're going to continue with that cycle knowing what it's costing you?  
* Why not?  
* What was the turning point?  
* What was the turning point before this call in your life regarding this situation where now you were actually willing to accept that challenge and go through that challenge?  
* When did you have that realization?  
* Why was $2,000 a lot of money for you?

# Ecom

Here is a transcript of where only Josh suggests questions or plays the salesperson in the roleplay, providing only the question itself:

* **in your opinion deario what is the biggest reason that you want your own successful amazon store right now**  
* **okay so you want to get out of the 9-to-f5 lifestyle and have more control over your time and over your money and you've been running that same lifestyle with lack of control over the the time and the money that you're making monthly for the last 10 years is that accurate**  
* **okay so if you've been doing that for the last 10 years has something shifted right now**  
* **was there was there any other shifts that made this a a now thing or was it the fact that you're you've now got a child on the way you got five more months until that child is born and you know that when that child's born obviously you've got all the expenses of the child but you've also got to take care of your wife who's not going to be working is that the single thing that has shifted this into first into the next gear or is there anything else**  
* **okay so in a month the bills that are currently split between you and your wife you're going to be fully responsible for all of those bills and right now if nothing changes that is something that you can't fulfill is that accurate**  
* **has that been a habit of yours in the past putting things off and telling yourself i'll do it later i'll do it later**  
* **specifically for changing your lifestyle where you would have more control you would have more time you would have more money specifically that area of life is this a is this a habit that you have continued to allow yourself to follow in that area of your life putting it off and just saying i'll do it later**  
* **okay so you have tried some things when was the last time you tried something**  
* **and what was that**  
* **and how did that go**  
* **$1,000 total over the three months or**  
* **how long were you trading for**  
* **and why did you stop that**  
* **time before that what did you try before that**  
* **how how what was the time period of you doing that prior to doing the trading what was the gap of time**  
* **how many more things would you say you've tried over the last say three years how many things would you say you've tried total you've done trading or tried trading tried affiliate marketing in three years how many things would you say you've tried**  
* **what about in the last 10 years since you've wanted a lifestyle change are those the only two things you've tried**  
* **what shifted a year ago then was was that you you deciding to get your wife pregnant or is there something else that shifted a year ago**  
* **okay so was there anything else that shifted a year ago**  
* **and what shifted after the second or the third promotion that you realized i guess your hope that promotions or or in your normal job was going to fix this lifestyle that you wanted to accomplish what what shifted about that**  
* **how much did you make last month**  
* **and the month before**  
* **are you on a set salary every month or does it change at all month to month**  
* **and what did your wife bring in last month**  
* **and so total between the two of you you've got $8,000 on a monthly basis obviously right now unless i misunderstood it's just you and your wife you don't have any other kids correct**  
* **first child is on the way in 5 months correct**  
* **how much do you think your financial necessities are going to change in five months have you got a ballpark figure of what that's going to be**  
* **when you when you hear yourself say that you've got a child on the way in 5 months and you haven't thought about how much money you're going to need does anything come up for you**  
* **does anything come up for you in regards to the approach that you're taking towards being a father to be 5 months from now**  
* **how do you feel about having to put on that responsibility**  
* **okay where was your thought process when you booked in this call to try something else not trading not affiliate marketing but try the next thing did something change in your thought process**  
* **was there any part of this baby that was like unplanned or you didn't actually want to have a child right now with this lady**  
* **what was the surprise**  
* **do you mind if i relay it back to you and you tell me if you think i'm an asshole for what i'm about to say if you agree if you disagree**  
* **can i share at least what i think i've picked up that you've put down**  
* **how do you feel about those four conclusions**  
* **how are you now showing up today are you showing up as someone that is reflective thinking things through is actually going to go for the right vehicle with the right support the right help for a long enough period of time to make it work isn't going to keep repeating the same things over and over and expecting a different result and actually isn't going to have any resentment at taking on the responsibility and putting on we could call it the burden of now being a husband to look after your wife and a father to look after your child**  
* **how do you actually feel about those four things in regards to why you haven't already got what you want**  
* **what do you think is the likelihood that you make better decisions when your current mindset to why you have to make those decisions is you feel forced into it**  
* **correct me if i'm wrong are you saying that yes this was something that you didn't plan to be forced into this situation per se it's also something that because it feels forced upon you you you deal you do still feel that you know shit i didn't really ask for this but it sounds like the way you're now approaching that force on you is i probably did need something to make me grow up to make me actually accomplish these things that i want to and i'm actually going to embrace that force that's being exerted on me my wife my kid to kid to be is that accurate**  
* **why is that accurate**  
* **how much do you really want to get those results be honest with yourself**  
* **how much do you really really want to get these things now**  
* **why**  
* **would you say you're in that category right now like before this conversation we've been having for the last 15 minutes and the honesty that you're now starting to reflect are you in that category**  
* **why does the baby need to be here for you to know are you in the category of the husband and the father father to be whe whether the baby's out or the baby's in your wife's tummy you are now in preparation to be a father in forget fatherhood you've been a husband your wife could have not had to work for the last four months so why does the baby not being here right now mean that you're detaching yourself from whether you're in that category or not**  
* **am i putting it a way that's true or am i manipulating the truth what do you feel**  
* **how does that make you feel to actually face reality**  
* **how much longer do you want to either be in that category or be in that category but you're denying to yourself that you're in that category either one is the same thing we're looking at it from two different sides but my question is how much longer are you willing to stay there and not actually get into the category that you say you want to be in or specifically not be in the category any longer that you don't want to be in how much longer**  
* **do you want to wait another day another week another month another five months**  
* **how much longer are you going to wait**  
* **how long is much because that lack of specificity is another example of you not thinking about it take take 30 seconds take as long as you need i can put this call on mute go do something else and come back but you need to actually think about my question how much longer are you going to stay in this category**  
* **are you sure**  
* **why are you going to make such a draft drastic shift from being the guy that waited nine years before making any single shifts to now being the guy that acts today acts immediately what has shifted for you to make such a drastic shift in the way you're showing up right now**  
* **does that make sense what do you think about that**  
* **how do you feel about the decision to potentially work with us and align yourself with us knowing that you didn't have that figure in your life you're not showing up as that figure in your life and now you've found your way onto a phone call with someone that is representing what you always wanted and what you want to continue doing moving forward how does that connect with you now feeling certain that you're going to be making better decisions does that have an impact does it change nothing any thoughts there**  
* **are we in agreement on that**  
* **why if you do do you feel the better decision for your next vehicle and hopefully not next last one is going to be an amazon fba business why if you do is that the better decision than the decisions you made previously**  
* **how you feel about the timing that you need to put in in regards to building an amazon fba business and i mean timing in terms of what times of day to do it and also given the fact that you've got a pregnant wife that's going to get more and more pregnant over the next 5 months how do you feel in regards to your time that you're able to commit to making this a reality**  
* **how much time are you going to make on a weekly basis how much time are you going to commit to making on a weekly basis**  
* **and how does that fit in with your 9 to5**  
* **break down how 30 hours is going to be spread out through the week for you in terms of if i join the program**  
* **how are you going to put 30 hours into your week**  
* **what i mean is when are you going to put when are you going to do those 30 hours**  
* **why do you think i'm asking you all of these specifics**  
* **why do you think i'm being so specific on you personally**  
* **why specifically for you would that not be okay to continue like that hence why i'm going into all these details with you**  
* **make sense**  
* **so let's go into the 30 hours how many hours on a weekday how many hours on a weekend how are you going to fit that in**  
* **why if you do do you feel like the better decision for you to make now is not repeating what you did with the affiliate marketing which is where you had no clear direction why is why is following that not going to be a better decision**  
* **can you rephrase that**  
* **if that's what happened with the affiliate marketing what is the better decision that you need to make for having a successful amazon fba business in regards to having clear direction**  
* **why specifically do you want us to mentor you to lay everything out for you so you can just do it what was it about us that attracted you**  
* **what mattered most if i'm understanding you correctly is that now having had this conversation you know that we're the people that you want to hold you accountable during what is a do or die situation correct**  
* **why why us**  
* **was there anything specific about this conversation that makes you feel if you do given that it's your first conversation that you don't want to spend more time looking around and see if there's anybody else that gives you a more impactful conversation than this**  
* **how are you going to make a better decision on working through that investment when it comes up at the end of this call what are you going to tell yourself or talk yourself through to actually make the investment to get a mentor that is going to give you a laidout plan and you can just do it**  
* **given that you've been okay being in that category for the n last 9 years what is it that's really shaken you up to not be willing to stay in that category any longer when it comes to pulling the trigger on a financial investment i want to know a little bit more detail as far as i mean all all you'll be doing if you don't pull the trigger is staying in the category that you've been in for the last 9 years doesn't sound that bad when you put it like that so why if it is is it going to be so bad for you now**  
* **is that accurate**  
* **is there anything i missed is there anything you would like to change**  
* **how much longer do you want to not have the external accountability that you know you need and stay in the category of man father that you no longer want to stay in how much longer**

# Back Pain

Here are the questions suggested or asked by Josh:

* **How many times have you tweaked your back**  
* **Where would you put that on a scale of 1 to 10**  
* **When you had previously tweaked your back between the times that you tweaked your back did you have this level of hyperactivity and fear in the past**  
* **Why is this time different**  
* **Is this hyperactivity that you have now and this fear is it different to in the past**  
* **Is that any different now Jeremy to what it was like when you previously tweaked your back in the past**  
* **Why**  
* **How much longer do you want to continue having this hyperactivity**  
* **Why does that matter**  
* **How does that connect to your fear of you know tweaking your back Jeremy**  
* **What exactly is going on for you right now that has you potentially wanting to get this solved at the root cause**  
* **What's been bothering you about it**  
* **Is there anything that's changed in regards to this relationship with the women with kids has that shifted something in your mind**  
* **Is there something that's a specific reason that you need to get this handled right now**  
* **Is there something else Jeremy that has kind of led you to wanting to get this solved right now**  
* **When you say here we go again Jeremy what do you mean by that**  
* **Has it led to a huge drop in income for you right now**  
* **In the past how long has it taken you out for**  
* **What do you think is the likelihood if you don't get this handled based on how you feel now compared to the last time you had that pop how likely do you think it is it will be another five weeks**  
* **What is the likelihood if you to put it as a percentage that if nothing changes it is going to be somewhere between another four to six weeks**  
* **What is the cost that that's going to be for you in terms of losing clients not enrolling new clients potentially refunding clients take for example in the last 30 days what did you generate in your business from new**  
* **How would your ability to generate new sales be affected over the next 5 weeks if you don't get this handled would that go to to zero basically or what would that look like**  
* **You think that would affect your close rate in any way**  
* **If nothing changes what is the current cost that you basically have over your head if you don't fix this in terms of we'll start with the new business over the next five weeks that isn't going to come in if nothing changes What would you put that at**  
* **In terms of your existing clients that you would still have to fulfill over the next 5 to 6 weeks what is kind of the the total revenue of those existing clients that you kind of still have to fulfill**  
* **If you stay with how you currently feel if you were to just ballpark the number how many clients do you think are going to ask for either a full or a partial refund**  
* **How long has this you know been going on for where you're out for 5 to 6 weeks**  
* **How many times in the last 3 years has that happened**  
* **Are you telling me that because you didn't get this handled 3 years ago at the root cause 5 time $50,000 it's already cost you $250,000**  
* **Was there something that shifted now as to why you're not going to add another 50,000 to the total cost that you've paid for not resolving this**  
* **What kind of financial impact did that have**  
* **How much is that going to set you back currently**  
* **Are you going to be able to fulfill their needs**  
* **How worried are you that you being able to fight through it will lead to a refund**  
* **Can you help me understand why this matters**  
* **Aside from maybe just being a very good person why does that matter**  
* **What do you think is the likelihood that that repeats itself right now**  
* **What would that be costing you if if that number is accurate**  
* **Do you want to pay 40,000 or do you want to pay five**  
* **How worried is that quantifiably**  
* **What do you mean is going to get worse**  
* **Where would you put that in terms of 1 to 10 where would you put that like numbers**  
* **How likely do you think this is going to happen hence the worry**  
* **How does the severity of this time when it popped compared to last time**  
* **How does the severity of this time it popped and how you feel compared to last time**  
* **Can you can you go back a bit Jeremy i'm confused why you think this might be an 80% likelihood**  
* **Can you explain that**  
* **What would you say is the likelihood that you are going to be out of work for 5 to 6 weeks like last time**  
* **In your opinion what do you feel is the likelihood that you're out for another 5 weeks**  
* **Are you willing to roll the dice on $50,000 for hope**  
* **Do you want to do that**  
* **What do you want to do**  
* **Do you think a $67 PDF is the amount of commitment you would like to put into not paying that $250,000 any any longer**  
* **Do you think part of the problem in regards to why you've paid $250,000 over the last three years Jeremy has anything to do with the fact that your current approach to solving it is spending less than a hundred bucks and going through some books**  
* **Do you think that has anything to do with why you've paid such a big price**  
* **Do you feel that $67 investment is the level of commitment that you would like to put into choosing to not pay $50,000 in 30 days**  
* **Do you think a $67 crash course is trying hard enough to actually fix this**  
* **What do you think you need**  
* **Do you want me to make some suggestions of what some of our other clients have used which were in the same position as you three years had gone by they kept procrastinating and they'd paid hundreds of thousands of dollars Do you want me to share what they did**  
* **What do you think about that**  
* **Do you think it would be awesome enough that you'd be willing to make a significantly larger investment to not pay 250,000**  
* **My question was do you think all of those additional leverage points are worth it or would you rather roll the dice on hope that you don't pay $50,000 which in your words was 100% likely in the next 30 days**

# Content Creation

Below is a transcript of only Josh's questions and statements when he is playing the salesperson in the roleplay:

* **All right Lee So in your opinion what is the biggest challenge you're having getting clients from short form content right now**  
* **Okay So you're using short form content as part of your lead genen strategy but it's not consistent and it's very up and down Correct**  
* **Okay So let's go into the consistency over the last seven days So how many leads did you get from short form content yesterday**  
* **What about the day before**  
* **The day before that if you recall**  
* **What about total in the last seven days**  
* **Okay so it sounds like there was a bunch of days that were zero some that were two 1 three thereabouts correct**  
* **okay so that was in the last week How does that compare to the consistency that you had the week before so this last seven days was five What was it the week before**  
* **And what about the consistency on a week-to-week basis over the last month**  
* **Okay So month-to-month it's very up and down So let's break that down monthly then So how many total leads did you get in this total month i think you're saying it was 15**  
* **15 to 20 The month before Let me just check I have the numbers here Okay Um you just if you just ballpark the number you don't have to pull up all your Excel sheets things like that Just Got it**  
* **Well if it was 15 to 20 this last month and it was five the month before it's around about 75% less Is that accurate**  
* **What about the month before that so three months back now**  
* **How does that up and down compare over the last 12 months is it roughly 15 to 20 down to five back up to 15 20 down to five or is there bigger is there any bigger peaks and troughs that you've had over the last 12 months**  
* **And is is the average though a difference between about 15 to 20 leads is that roughly the difference i know you said 75% It's probably like a 50% difference if I had to average it out**  
* **Okay So some months it's 75% some it's maybe 25% but on average your lead generation from getting clients from short form is going up and down by 50% basically monthtomonth if we averaged it out**  
* **Let's then get into the numbers of that So when you get a lead what are I know you might have different price points but if you were to say the average sale what is one of those leads worth to you**  
* **Got it So 25,500 And if your average leads are going up and down by I mean you said you gave some examples of 75% but now we're saying more 50% Sounds like the difference in the leads is somewhere around about 10 per month if we were to just average it out Does that sound about accurate**  
* **So your business month-to-month has a inconsistency of about $25,000 per month**  
* **h but whether you get the lead or whether you don't get the lead the close rate percentage is going to be the same In other words that variable is not what we're looking at We're looking at just changing the lead flow Does that make sense**  
* **If you had double the amount of lead flow consistently the opportunity cost of that is basically $25,000 If you had your current normal best month became your average month whereas right now you have 15 to 20 down to five 15 to 20 down to five some something like that Does that make sense**  
* **You mentioned close rate percentage We will get into that So we may as well do that now Mhm What is the quality of these leads and by quality I specifically mean the 15 to 20 leads that you get some months the five that you get other months What is the current average close rate on those leads**  
* **So your lead flow is going up and down by 50% month-to-month And the quality of these leads is I know you could say it could be some of the salespeople but if we just focus on what you can do as a business owner 70% of those leads are potentially not qualified**  
* **All right So as far as running a business these are really like the two most important numbers Opportunity and closing that opportunity So what impact is it having on the business given the fact that this is your challenge with getting enough consistent qualified leads on a month-to-month basis what what impact is that having on the business**  
* **You were mentioning something about it's it's not something but then you cut out**  
* **So it sounds like even though the revenue is decent it's not changing It's not improving It's not growing because of the inconsistency in your lead flow but also the inconsistency in getting the wrong fit for a lot of the leads that you are generating Is that accurate**  
* **Why do you think it is that this is the result that you're getting with your short form content**  
* **Okay let's get into what you are doing in regards to posting So how many videos did you post yesterday**  
* **how does that compare to an average day over the last week is that the same is that more than Did you have days where you didn't post**  
* **When you hear that you're struggling with inconsistency in your business and potentially attracting the wrong fit of people how do you feel when you hear yourself saying that you're sometimes not posting for two or three days**  
* **Maybe I misunderstood Let me check I understood You said in the past you were posting more consistently you then got disheartened with the results and so you've now started posting less Is that what I heard you say**  
* **So you okay so if I'm understanding you correctly you feel that the only variable to getting better consistency is the quality of the content It doesn't matter how often you're posting Is that your opinion**  
* **Interesting that you mentioned 50/50 in regards to 50/50 This could be having an impact It could be not having an impact The exact same ratio of inconsistency that you're experiencing 50/50 It's interesting How do you feel about that**  
* **Does that make sense**  
* **would we and I be open to posting more**  
* **Why do you think you've not been getting the results you've been looking for in regards to you being the one at the helm creating the short form content why like why do I think the results aren't working from what we're doing**  
* **Why do you feel you're struggling with the hooks and with the engagement and with people staying**  
* **Oh and and where are you getting those test ideas from**  
* **So you're trying a bunch of different people's different things that you're trying to piece meal together from free content Do you have any type of strategy or plan or training or experience in this**  
* **When you say it wasn't what you were looking for what were you looking for**  
* **And so did you know that it was going to be more do it yourself when you engaged in that service**  
* **oh so you're saying now you want hands-on but back then you didn't know whether you could do it as a do-it-yourself course**  
* **So you so you previously you had no training no experience no strategy Recently you then hired some do-it-yourself training You've done that training and it wasn't hands-on enough for you and now you know you need hands-on training Is that accurate**  
* **You said it but I think I missed it When did you uh engage that service that was do it yourself that training**  
* **But you said this has been for 18 months So what shifted a year after not getting the results you wanted that now 6 months ago you said okay we need to take action on outside help**  
* **correct me if I'm wrong but I think I'm missing the timeline you said that this inconsistency and not having the right lead that is a fit has been 18 months But then you said 6 months ago from today you hired outside help So there's a 12 month period where you didn't hire help or let**  
* **Does that make sense**  
* **it does but maybe maybe we're speaking on different threads here So are you saying you hired that service 12 months ago not 6 months ago**  
* **Okay that's what I was not clear on Okay that makes sense It was 12 months ago So you set yourself a timeline I'm going to try and figure this out for 6 months Didn't figure it out We'll hire some outside help We'll do a do it yourself Nothing to lose Tried that for 6 months That didn't work And now the conclusion you've had is we need hands-on training**  
* **So if I'm understanding correctly it's been another 6 months since you had that realization before now reaching out to us Is that accurate**  
* **How many calls have you been on in 6 months**  
* **any particular reason it's taking you two months to find another potential opportunity that you want to explore**  
* **What I also want to get into is what is the business setup in regards to is this a sole business for you do you have business partners how does this fit into your kind of entrepreneurial journey should we say**  
* **So you're the only business owner And so for 18 months you've had inconsistency in the business It's been going up and down by $25,000 thereabouts It's quite a long period of time I mean we could argue numbers there but 18 months is quite a long period to be suffering inconsistency You had that disheartened phase You've been trying a few different things every couple months Is this having a an impact on you like forget business but just you having a lifestyle and an income that's so inconsistent**  
* **What specific things can't you do because of the inconsistency**  
* **So have you not done that in the last 18 months**  
* **What else have you not done in the last 18 months because of the inconsistency**  
* **But will it will it happen if the business stays inconsistent**  
* **But would you actually make the move to a new house and the expenses of that if you know that your income is inconsistent**  
* **And this partner that you've been with has she has she experienced the inconsistency for the last 18 months alongside you**  
* **experience it in what way exactly**  
* **I'm just curious has she has she experienced that it's been so inconsistent for the last 18 months like you know it has been**  
* **How happy is your wife right now with you having the inconsistency in your business and your income**  
* **How much longer if everything stayed the same**  
* **How long have you been with this partner**  
* **If you'd have actually got this handled 18 months ago the difference between you having handled it then and you not getting it handled would be three and a half years so close to four half of the entire time that you've been in that relationship is how long you'll force that partner to wait because you haven't actually got this handled Does that make sense**  
* **You are looking at it that way What's coming up for you how do you feel**  
* **With what**  
* **Just to be clear who's we**  
* **The other thing is you mentioned travel and you mentioned that you haven't been able to do that How important is travel for you in regards to the uh you said why you got into business is that a big thing for you is that oh it's just a nice to have**  
* **Just secondly is there any particular reason that you keep swinging it back to we you've done that twice I'm just curious is there any reason for that**  
* **Do you view it in your mind that your wife is responsible for the income that you're generating and being able to take her on holiday being able to get the house do you view it as a partnership in regards to she has inputs that are generating the outputs or is this your responsibility and you're the one that is making this happen or not i'm just curious how you see things**  
* **Does she have any input in regards to getting this solved**  
* **So so when you say you discuss big decisions did you discuss the previous three I think it was three three people that you spoke to to try and get this solved with your partner**  
* **And really about it in what sense really about it as in if the call goes well you don't need her approval or permission to make a financial decision or what what do you mean i'm just trying to understand your relationship in regards to your business with your wife**  
* **And you mentioned that she hasn't expressed frustration but you know your wife you've been with her for eight years Do you feel that she is happy with the situation whether she's expressing it or not**  
* **Can I be direct with you**  
* **And you can tell me if you disagree with this but based on the results that you're getting which are very inconsistent Do you think it's fair to say that someone who is consistently trying very hard would get inconsistent results**  
* **Why not**  
* **So if you're having inconsistent results to grow your business at the rate you want to for 18 months how hard have you really been trying to get this solved over the last 18 months**  
* **If you to put on a scale of one 1 to 10 as far as how hard you have been consistently trying to get this solved Mhm Knowing that you could have tried harder where would you put yourself zero being I didn't try very hard very consistently 10 being I've put in massive action consistently for a long period of time to get this solved Where would you have put yourself over the last 18 months**  
* **Interesting Okay So you view spending somewhere around about 6 months being disheartened and therefore dropping down to only producing one piece of content every two to three days Plus having just three discussions with services over the last 6 months none of which you took action on Of those three and only hiring a done uh sorry a do-it-yourself program that being your last 18 months of inputs you view that as a 6 out of 10 of trying very hard to get this solved**  
* **Well you can call it whatever you want You can call it due diligence if you want but I was burnt and therefore I'm going to take less action on less things What level of diligence is that to getting a problem solved is that going to make it more likely you solve it or less likely**  
* **you can call it whatever you want You can call it due diligence but it's basically just I'm playing safe I'm contracting I'm you know got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder that something didn't work Therefore I'm going to take less action Is that accurate or is that inaccurate**  
* **Why**  
* **I'm going to run you through my timelines of things Tell me if you disagree with anything and we'll see what makes sense after that The first six months you tried to figure this out on your own which if someone said they were trying very hard to figure something out would they have tried it on their own if they've never done it before**  
* **why do you view that as trying harder than someone who's never done something before saying "Hey I've never done this before Instead of trial and error I'm going to try very hard to make sure I have a high likelihood of solving this I'm going to hire somebody that's already solved it Why do you view your option as trying harder than the second option**  
* **Okay Hindsight 2020 vision looking backwards Which of those two would you now view as trying harder spending the first 6 months testing things trying things experimenting on your own or if you'd have spent the first 6 months saying "I don't want to test things I just want to follow a proven formula In hindsight which do you view as trying harder to solve a problem**  
* **Okay so that's your first 6 months The second 6 months you hired some do-it-yourself which okay fair enough You thought maybe with some training even though it's do it oursel we could maybe get this done That didn't work out somewhere around about this 12 month mark you know trying it yourself trying the do-it-yourself uh do it uh do-it-yourself support you got pretty disheartened and you've dropped down to only posting two or three times a day Uh sorry two or three times sorry once every two or three days So you've reduced your volume quite significantly And then now you've spent six months hopping on a few phone calls saying that people were not aligned when I mean I get it from a phone call you could say are definitely not aligned with this person But not taking action on anything for the last 6 months Hard to say if you know that none of those things would have been at least a big help Cuz being direct with you Lee from my point of view the biggest reason that you haven't had consistency is your perspective of what is trying very hard If you want consistency our perspective at Devon's company at Viral Flow or Nexus whatever he calls it is trying very hard is massive action with a mentor that's already figured it out and doing that every single day showing up every day whether you want to whether you don't want to whether you're disheartened whether you're not disheartened whether you're getting immediate results or whether you're trying to stack the deck in your favor to get results That is what we view as trying very hard And so right now I'm not sure if we have alignment in regards to whether you would actually get consistent results based on your current perspective of what is trying very hard How do you feel about that**  
* **Why if you are are you willing to hold your hands up now**  
* **What what shifted as far as you putting your hands up and saying I I haven't been trying very hard**  
* **Okay Why does something have to change for you personally like I understand the business is inconsistent but you've managed to make do with that inconsistency for 18 months Is there anything like in the other areas of your life which is why now is the time to not just get the help but to say I'm going to take ownership put my hands up that I haven't been trying as hard as I could and therefore I'm going to get the help**  
* **How consistent do you think his lead genen is as far as getting people that are a fit and people that are consistently the same number of leads per day**  
* **How hard do you think he's been trying for the last 18 months**  
* **Okay So you had a conversation a month ago Mhm It took you a month to book in a call**  
* **What exactly were you getting planned for the future home that you said you wouldn't be moving into for another 2 years if nothing changes what were you doing**  
* **Can you explain why you were looking at houses that you said you wouldn't be moving into for another two years and that activity took you away from taking the action that you needed to take to actually have the consistency to be able to get into the house sooner why were you looking at houses**  
* **So you're saying that you went to look for the house because you were absolutely certain that you're going to hire outside help right now and try much much harder to get this solved so that that does become a reality You're kind of manifesting it should we say**  
* **Interesting Was there something that shifted to you taking that very decisive action to go and look at that house**  
* **How much is the house that you want**  
* **When you hear that how does that make you feel**  
* **Aside from the fact that your buddy's in the program is there any other particular reason you want Devon's help rather than anybody else**  
* **And I'm going to be very blunt with you Lee Is that okay**  
* **You've had a lot of inconsistency in your business inconsistency to the point where comparing it to not some hypothetical could have done this would have done that but what your buddy actually did that inconsistency has cost you at least 540,000 That's the merit of that inconsistency And the reason that you've had that inconsistency is you have had a perspective or we could just call it telling yourself that you have been trying very hard to get this solved And for 18 months you've done we could say sprinkled in enough of the activities that allowed you to continue with that rationalizing as far as well you know we hired some uh done with you help You know we we're doing a post every 2 or 3 days I tried figuring it out on my own for 6 months That was the timeline I gave myself I've hopped on three calls with different people You've kind of done enough to keep telling yourself that I'm trying hard enough I'm trying very hard But the turning point was when you spoke to your buddy and it sounds like and correct me if I'm wrong that when you saw that he's made $540,000 more than you in the last 18 months Sounds like something broke as far as maybe I can't tell myself anymore that I've been trying very hard because he's a buddy of mine that started at the same time Doesn't seem like you think he has a higher IQ than you He just tried harder Is that accurate as far as kind of the timeline of what's been going on**  
* **And the reason that that connected as far as breaking your previous perspective was it's important to you that you and your partner that you've been with for 8 years move into this new home as soon as possible And if nothing changes it's going to be at least two years Another two years which would have been three and a half years of no travel most probably And the things that need to change as far as you trying very hard are getting the outside help from someone that has got the results on the hooks the engagement staying power of people watching the videos so that when you know that you've got quality content you can then combine that with quantity of content Is that all accurate**  
* **When you hear that summary and piecing it all together for you tell me what you think about that**  
* **Do you know how much he would have made if you waited another 18 months like you have the last 18 months**  
* **Is there anything that we haven't covered as far as connecting all the dots here that you think I should know**  
* **Okay So then being honest with you again Lee and being direct how many more days are you willing to not try as hard as you really need to try to fix this inconsistency in your business**  
* **What do you mean if you see given that you know somebody that's in the program that's got the results you want is there a is there some doubt that you have**  
* **But I'm I'm curious why you said that like if if I feel this can get me what I need and has what I need Why did you say that**  
* **just out of curiosity what if the program told you so that you don't lose another $540,000 not doing what your buddy did you have to stand on your head three times a day Like does does that matter**  
* **So what does matter as far as you actually trying very hard what what matters**  
* **If if we show you this is the exact same program that your buddy's in that got the result that you wanted had the entire cash amount for the house that you wanted to have and we just tell you you got to do this this this this this this and this Is there going to be any resistance to you just doing it and saying "I don't I don't really like working on a Monday." Or "Oh I don't really like that feature on Instagram." Or or are you just going to do what we tell you so you get the result and the reason I'm being direct on you Lee is because this sounds very similar to the rationalizing you were doing for the last 18 months of I'm trying very hard but actually you're not this is a different version of it but you're basically like "Oh I need to know all the details cuz those things matter." They would definitely matter if you didn't have someone that's in the program that's got the exact result that you want So having a discussion about this now how how do you feel now**  
* **Why what what shifted from five minutes ago when you were trying to say you know I need to know that it it's not not needing to know There's nothing wrong with needing to know I'm going to take you through all the details It's using the word if If if this is what I need why did you say or what shifted from you saying that 5 minutes ago to now you saying it's not an if it's a when When am I going to take action and the answer is right now What shifted**  
* **How much longer are you going to keep letting these little rationalizations cost you the ability to move in the home when you want to the ability to keep your wife happy happy wife happy life the ability to go traveling How many more little rationalizations are you going to let slip through knowing that the cost of those rationalizations is the life that you want to live**  
* **Why**  
* **If you like I can take you through all the details so that you just are aware of them so you know how we're going to get you the same result that we got your friends So long as you do try hard and you put in the work So if you're ready I can basically break that all down for you and we'll uh go into all those details**

# Sales Trainer

Here is the transcript of only Josh's questions or instances where he plays the salesperson in the roleplay:

* **And how how long have you been on this offer Don for about a year and a half?**  
* **How has your income compared to that over the last year and a half?**  
* **So you started at 4 1/2K a year and a half later you're at the same place again 4 1/2K and for an entire year in the middle you were at 7 1/2K and you didn't make any financial progress Is that accurate Don?**  
* **So a year and a half ago you're at four four to 5K 18 months later you're making the same amount of money You haven't made any progress And in the middle there was a period where you were making 7 12 to 8K but for an entire year that number didn't increase Is that accurate?**  
* **So it sounds like Don if I wanted to go a bit further it sounds like Don you've you've basically spent a year and a half to not make any progress in the grand scheme of things Is that accurate?**  
* **Why do you think that is?**  
* **And so given that you were on this offer not making progress for an entire year once you know the leads were better which was you know the 7.5 to 8K any particular reason you didn't change offer?**  
* **Was there anything specific that you were doing during that year where you didn't increase your income at 7 12 to 8K Was there anything you were doing?**  
* **Okay Don So you you say that you're the type of person that doesn't like not making progress A year and a half has gone by you haven't made progress but if I'm understanding correctly during the year when you're at 7 and 12 to 8K you weren't making any progress but you weren't doing anything about it Is that accurate?**  
* **Interesting Okay what specifically were you doing?**  
* **And how many hours were you spending on that?**  
* **So so for a year you spent 480 hours on blank blank blank training yet you didn't make any progress I mean you're now 6 months after that Have you come up with any reasons why you think that is?**  
* **Why Why did you come to that conclusion?**  
* **Do you have a highle mentor?**  
* **Are you in a high level community?**  
* **And are you taking massive action on regular training?**  
* **You said you want this but you're doing this Why?**  
* **So what was there anything that you were doing over that year when you were stuck at 7 and a half to 8K to try to make progress?**  
* **So during that year Don when you weren't making any progress was there anything you were doing to try and get out of that place where you weren't making progress?**  
* **So is there any particular difference between you were quite content with going through a year of not making any progress 6 months ago to now telling me and telling yourself that you're no longer willing to not be making progress Is there any difference between then and now?**  
* **So to make sure I'm clear are you saying that you want your income to get back to 7 and a half to 8K and so long as it stays there indefinitely that's totally fine or is anything different?**  
* **So what what's changed with the drop in the income that now something has to change?**  
* **Why is that not sustainable?**  
* **What about those things is making it not sustainable?**  
* **I don't want to put words in your mouth but are you saying you can't make those bills right now and you're going into debt or or what's going on?**  
* **And how does where your income is now compared to your expenses?**  
* **Anything else?**  
* **How long has your income been less than your expenses?**  
* **During the last three months to cover your expenses which were less than your income you've been using credit cards and you've been using savings How much have you put on credit card?**  
* **How much credit card debt are you are you in?**  
* **Where did that come from?**  
* **So what I'm curious about Don is is there any particular reason that it seems like wherever you've been in terms of your income you've never been able to cover whatever you need to buy?**  
* **How long has it been?**  
* **So how long has it been Don that the amount of money you've been making has not been able to cover anything and everything that you need to pay for including those unexpected expenses?**  
* **So the issue Don is that you're trying to cover a twoerson income with one person Is that accurate?**  
* **So my question then is what is the likelihood anytime in the near future that you go back from a one person income to a twoerson income?**  
* **So Don what's the likelihood in the near future that you would go from a one-person income household to a two-person income household?**  
* **When?**  
* **And when is that?**  
* **And and when is that expected to happen?**  
* **When is that planned for?**  
* **I'm curious Don What had you added up or thought about that led to being on this call?**  
* **Okay interesting And when you think about it now how do you feel?**  
* **Now I'm curious Don I know you said you hadn't thought about it but obviously something had come up that you booked in this call anything particular that had come up?**  
* **Up to this point when you booked the call what had been going through your mind?**  
* **Was there something in particular that happened in month three when you realized that something needs to change?**  
* **So and it sounds like cuz I asked you earlier on in this call was there anything you did during the year when you were making 8K to increase your income And now we know that your income has never been enough to cover your expenses I I really want to understand has something shifted drastically for you that you are now approaching this with a very different perspective than you have for the last year and a half?**  
* **I don't understand how the sustainability of the last year and a half is any different to the sustainability now?**  
* **Okay So just again just again say okay Don but I'm I'm still not clear on why why now?**  
* **In your opinion why do you think I keep asking you for a reason that given that 18 months have gone by and you've not done anything about this that now you're going to do something about it?**  
* **Well if you think about it why do you think that matters?**  
* **Why do you think you need a reason?**  
* **And so given that when you started looking at the finances and then you went to apply for another credit card which you thought no worries I'll just get another credit card when that declined word popped up on your screen How did you feel?**  
* **Do you still feel like you're drowning now then if you haven't been able to get that lifeline?**  
* **When you say drowning what what is that daytoday for you?**  
* **Is that pressure is that bubbling over in any way?**  
* **How is it wearing on you right now?**  
* **Is there maybe one two or three specific wares that you're feeling?**  
* **What Absolutely Protect them from what?**  
* **Like you obviously know yourself You don't have to tell me any details but do you feel like this is going to bubble over in a way that you might not be able to protect your family from if you don't get it resolved?**  
* **Are you willing to keep your family around a dangerous explosive any longer?**  
* **How long do you think the fuse is?**  
* **How short do you think it is right now?**  
* **If you were to bullpark it do you think you can hold this together and protect your family from the inevitable for another 6 months another year?**  
* **So then my my final question to you Don is let's shift gears here a little bit is what do you think has caused in your mind your family to now be in this dangerous place where they are around a bomb and they have 30 days left on the fuse?**  
* **Absolutely And what do you think has caused you to not be making enough money that has now put your family in this position?**  
* **Are you willing to keep your family whether it's today with this bomb or another bomb in the future or another bomb in a different context are you willing to keep threatening the well-being of the people you love due to your lack of initiative in the future?**  
* **Why?**  
* **And what's different now that you feel your family deserve more in regards to your initiative and your proactiveness than 18 months ago where you were still not being proactive what what has shifted in your values your beliefs your mindset as to why now's different?**  
* **And when you think about the fact that you putting your head in the sand and being unaware consciously choosing to be unaware has now put your family in this position How does that make you feel about yourself?**  
* **Are you at the point where you're no longer be no longer willing to be the person endangering your family and actually shift into the proactive man the man who takes initiative that is actually protecting your family?**  
* **When As soon as possible Next week next month next year When is that?**  
* **let's just say that what we go through later on is not really aligned with what you're looking for What are you going to do then?**  
* **but are you telling me that whatever it is you're not going to let another day go by that you're not proactively with initiative moving forward on solving this problem?**  
* **Does that make sense?**  
* **Why does that make sense to you?**  
* **Do you want me to take you through what we've got going on?**

# Fitness Offer2

Here are the questions Josh asks during the sales roleplay:

* **What is the biggest challenge that you're having in your fitness right now?**  
* **It sounds like the big thing as far as your old self is is muscle, is that accurate?**  
* **What is it showing you?**  
* **It sounds like the biggest thing is that now you're in your 40s and you've got less drive, the result of that is you don't have as much of a muscular physique that is getting compliments, getting you noticed when you walk into a room, is that accurate?**  
* **What is your physique looking like right now in terms of muscle, in in your opinion?**  
* **Some of your buddies make fun of you and the other people, are they giving you compliments or are they not giving you compliments like other civilians, are they giving you compliments?**  
* **When you used to walk into a room when you had this muscular physique that you had before, how often did you feel that you had a presence that got noticed or recognized in the past?**  
* **And what about now, if you said in the last week when you've walked into a room, you've gone down to the grocery shop or wherever you go, how many times if you to put it on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being I get recognized all the time and I get compliments all the time like I did in the past and zero being it never happened in the last week, where would you put that right now?**  
* **And how often do you choose the right clothing then?**  
* **Why not just wear the clothes that you get complimented in all the time and then that would fix your problem?**  
* **You feel that you're having to choose one or the other and that kind of sacrifice is sounds like that's what's bothering you, is that accurate?**  
* **Can I ask you a specific question on that, do you feel your best when your body feels the best or do you feel your best when other people notice that your body is its best?**  
* **How do you feel about your strength right now?**  
* **It sounds like the biggest thing is that whilst a lot of people would maybe be very happy with where you're at in terms of strength for your age, how you look, your fashion, you have these standards that are severely higher than the average civilian, should we call it your standard is you want to win, you want to win big, you want to win way ahead of everyone else and you want to win every time and compared to that standard you in your words you're like am I near the end, am I am I the person I used to be and it's kind of having this like identity crisis on you, is that accurate?**  
* **Is it having an impact on your dating life that you don't feel you know the person that you've always been known for, you don't feel yourself, should I say?**  
* **Back in the past when you were more driven and you were doing the workouts and you were you know living life the way you were in the past, what level would you have said you were at on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being I'm at the peak level and zero being I'm at you know civilian level, where would you have put yourself in the past?**  
* **Where are you at now in terms of your level?**  
* **Can I challenge you on that based on what you're saying, as far as you know the level I'm doing pretty well, the standards I'm I'm winning but I'm not winning at the level I want, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like there's more of a gap than you being a seven and you were a nine like it, and I'm not trying to put you down?**  
* **It sounds like it's bothering you more than I've only gone down by like two points from a 9.5 to a seven, am I missing something?**  
* **Do you feel you're at a six or a seven as far as the level that you're at compared to the standard that you would like to be at, do you feel that you're like 70% of the way there?**  
* **So where are you really, now that now that you put it that way?**  
* **When that did happen recently, how did that make you feel?**  
* **What I'm hearing and and I'd like you to see if you can help me reconcile this is you used to have more drive you used to be doing the workouts that were getting you this physique that you were known for whether it was conditioning whether it was muscle whether it was your literal capability rolling around in the MMA octagon and where you're at now whether it be a girl pinching some of your fat on your stomach or you know your standards internally you're not there but what I'm not clear on is the way you're expressing this you know you said like "I was annoyed i was a little bit peeved." I'm not reconciling like how you're describing this bothering you or affecting you with these very very high standards that you're telling me that you have for yourself in other words there's like a discrepancy between my standards are here and I'm currently here but the way you're expressing this gap is it doesn't sound like it's that big of a deal, does that make sense?**  
* **Either it is bothering you to the point where you have sleepless nights about this and you need to do something about it right now or it's not, there's not really anything that's going to change if it's somewhere in the middle and what I'm hearing from you right now is it's kind of in the middle, am I missing something?**  
* **Does the kind of disorder that you had in the past and kind of trying to wrap your head around how this has happened, is that currently some type of coping mechanism for you accepting that this is truly bothering you, is is is that where this connects in the middle, I'm trying to understand that?**  
* **What do you mean by like a coping mechanism?**  
* **What do you mean by downward slope?**  
* **What was going downward?**  
* **And what has not been the same?**  
* **How visible was that for you in terms of people giving you a compliment, how much did that shift you being known for your physique over the last you know 3 to six months losing 8 pounds of muscle?**  
* **In terms of like do you just take it as buddy love and friends just joking with each other or does it actually affect you?**  
* **How does it feel to go from always the winner, always the top dog, always the guy known for achievement in your physique, your muscle, your performance, your hierarchy in your peer group, to now not being the winner, how do you actually feel deep down?**  
* **What is yourself in your mind?**  
* **I'm going to ask you how is your pride now?**  
* **What is your current feeling of pride?**  
* **Is there anything that's keeping you from learning to trust yourself to push your body again when by the sound of it you are pretty in tune with your body for the last 40 years, the only challenge was this medical issue I went through where the chessboard was thrown up in the air, the same rules weren't applying to me because some of these things are out of my control and now that I'm out of that I'm starting to remember okay this is who I am but the workouts I'm doing right now they're you know they're sprints they're 20 30 minutes whereas I was literally doing two a days five six seven days a week like a psychopath and that's actually when I'm the most happier?**  
* **Do you feel ashamed that you've gone from being the guy that was known for outdoing anybody, being the guy to get advice from, to the guy that is now with all due respect being made fun of by your peer group, being made fun of by the girl that you're dating, I know she didn't mean it maliciously but hey got a bit of fat here let me pinch this, do you feel ashamed that you've gone from up here in your standards to back down to normal civilian level?**  
* **What does tugs at you mean?**  
* **What actually happens?**  
* **Does this make sense?**  
* **Do you think that lack of feeling it and therefore expressing it has been the reason that you've stayed at this middle of the road standard in terms of your physique?**  
* **What do you think would happen if you were as boastful of your disappointment and frustration with your current physique as you were about your pride for your old physique, what do you think making that shift would do in terms of you getting the result that you want if you were as boastful about I'm fucking fuming this is not myself this is not who I'm supposed to be, do you think that would have an impact on you actually getting out of this Groundhog Day as far as the standard that you're currently at?**  
* **Why why why did you repeat that?**  
* **Based on what we've been talking about, what do you think has caused you to continue going through this cycle of Groundhog Day?**  
* **Why do you think that's caused you to not have the internal fuel to make the changes that you need to make?**  
* **How did knowing that you need to get out of a silo and have competition and no longer just be in this status quo where you're in your own little environment, how did that awareness come into play when it came to booking this call and getting outside help?**  
* **How long has it been since you've done that, whether it be not standing on the shoulders of a giant, a mentor, healthy competition with your friends, how long have you been not operating in the way that has given you the results that you wanted in the past?**  
* **Are you at the point right now, maybe based on where you're at, maybe a combination of this conversation, are you at the point where you're no longer going to rob yourself of that type of environment or relationship, whether it be standing on the shoulders of a giant, having healthy competition that's currently keeping you from having the thriving living environment that you need to get out of this status quo, have you gotten to the point where you're no longer willing to stay out of that environment knowing what you need?**  
* **If I'm understanding correctly, you've not been in that situation for a year, is that accurate?**  
* **How much longer are you willing to stay in that place where it where you do have a choice, you could just not verbalize things, you could just not have a competition, you could just not have a girlfriend, how much longer are you going to stay, are you willing to stay in that position where it's not a no-choice position, it's not a win-lose competitive environment, another day, another week, another month, how much longer do you want to drag this out?**  
* **How much longer are you going to drag it out?**  
* **How much longer are you willing to be the only one not on the starting line, stood over there in your little silo, not verbalizing things and therefore not thriving?**  
* **Why, if you do, do you want to enter our race with our training, with our community, with our mentorship, rather than any of the other you know pick up and play races that are out there?**  
* **Does that make sense so far?**  
* **Anything to add on what I've covered so far?**  
* **Does that compare to how you felt when you hopped onto this call, because at least what I'm hearing is a little bit pissed off, is that any different to how it was 45 minutes ago, is there any difference in what you're feeling?**  
* **How does that feel for you to feel that again after all this time?**  
* **Does it feel like the person that you know yourself to be?**  
* **Correct me if I've missed anything wrong as a result of you not thriving and you not being the guy that you've always known yourself for you don't feel the aliveness that you used to feel, you don't feel you have that energy source and as a result of that the alternative that you feel is kind of just ashamed of yourself, you you just don't feel that pride anymore, the other thing that you mentioned which I think is really important is you said previously how you were living your life where you're in this competitive environment and you were therefore thriving you said those were your favorite memories now I don't know about you but for me life is just about stacking memories just stacking the good times having fun doing the things that make us feel alive and it sounds like the way you're living life now where you're not thriving and you're not yourself you're not outdoing everybody around you, correct me if I'm wrong Chris, but doesn't sound like you're having any good memories, you're just coasting, you're just going through life but you're not stacking these peak experience memories that it sounds like used to be back to back to back to back in the past, is that accurate?**  
* **Is everything I said accurate?**  
* **Is there anything that you want to add or anything you want to change?**  
* **The question is which one of those choices are you going to make?**  
* **Why?**  
* **How many more days are you willing to stay in a silo and not be living true to who you are?**  
* **Do you want to do that together?**  
* **Sound good?**

# Personal Dev

Here are the questions suggested by or asked by Josh in the roleplay:

* **Awesomely So just to make sure I'm clear you're now referring to turnover in terms of money for the company Before you were referring to turnover in terms of the amount of people that you were losing Is that correct**  
* **Okay got it So you tell me that it takes you 3 months to train people Is that accurate?**  
* **when you do have a three-month training period how many people do you hire to go through that training**  
* **And how many are you looking to get out of that are you looking to get 25 or you looking to get a fraction of that**  
* **Got it So you hire 25 and you're looking to keep 25 Is that accurate**  
* **last training cycle the last one that you had over that 3-month period How many did you get**  
* **So out of those 20 how many did you need at the end of the training cycle**  
* **So what you tried to do in 3 months takes you 6 months Is that correct**  
* **And for how many years has this been your your hiring process to scale your company**  
* **So in 5 years to accomplish what you wanted as far as human resource growth it's actually going to take you 10 years if nothing changes Is that accurate**  
* **It's how often do you do how often do you do these cycles**  
* **so at the moment you're doing a hiring cycle twice a year trying to bring on 10 people but only bring on five How many years have you been struggling with this**  
* **And and when I say struggling just to make sure we're clear is that struggling with roughly the same misalignment in what you need versus what you're getting in terms of employees**  
* **Okay so you're looking to scale the company obviously because you're looking to grow with hires What specifically are you hiring for in regards to these people that you're trying to get 10 of every uh 20 of actually every year in regards to their output for the company what is their role**  
* **So so Lee um you have two processes every year of uh training So you need indeed every year 20 people Was that the same last year when you started the process**  
* **So over the last two years with your current hiring process you're 20 people down on the company.' Is that accurate**  
* **Okay these 20 people that you're down I know it might be a bit of a range but just in general Lee what is the role of these people that you're currently missing 20 of**  
* **Now obviously as the CEO Lee I know you probably don't know all the detail numbers cuz you have managers but if you were to put a ballpark on it the revenue generated from maybe each of these people or if you want to just put it as a lump sum what would you say it's cost you as a company to be down by 20 of these people compared to your quotota**  
* **Hey I know you're the CEO You probably got managers to do all of the Excel sheets and all of that So you probably don't know the numbers exact but if you were to ballpark the number what would you say this is costing you to be down by 20 people that way of phrasing it**  
* **I know that there's probably a range of different people among those 20 but if you were to kind of lean the data in one direction as far as generally what type of roles you're looking for with those 20 people what would they be**  
* **Listen I know 20 people they're not all going to be the exact same role but as far as like the types of role if you were to kind of look at a more low-level role a more high level role a direct revenue generating role like a salesperson versus more of a an administrator kind of ballparking what are what are these 20 hires that you're missing that you are missing that you are down what are those highs**  
* **I'm confused or a bit curious Is there is there some type of implication of not having these people**  
* **if they're just like customer support I'm confused or curious like was there any particular incident or reason why being down by 20 customer support people has had some type of impact on the business**  
* **Can I ask a a direct question did you see a drop in your revenue after that**  
* **And you know again there's 20 of them so I'm assuming it's probably a range of different departments but any particular departments that you're really trying to fill these manager roles for**  
* **How many of those are for the sales team**  
* **Now I'm curious because you you really answered that question very quickly Any particular reason you focused on hiring you focused on the missing managers for the sales team**  
* **How so**  
* **Okay Got it So product development managers is what you're missing that seems to be a priority I'm curiously have you got any product development that you're trying to get handled**  
* **Okay why**  
* **how many of the managers are supposed to be for the product development just to get that number**  
* **Is that accurate**  
* **So I'm curious given that half of your issue with HR is specifically affecting managers for this very important role whatever blah blah blah What impact is that having on I guess any particular product development you're trying to do right now**  
* **How long was it supposed to be in development**  
* **What led to you wanting to build this product**  
* **When you say stagnant where where did it get stuck at**  
* **What were you expecting the growth to be if you had have secured that new product in time**  
* **So correct me if I've done this maths incorrectly here Lee but are you saying that by not getting this done in 6 months and still having not got it done in 2 years that would have been 3 million a year which is 6 million in 2 years obviously you wouldn't have had the first 1.5 because it would have taken you six months to build it So you're basically down correct me if this is wrong by 4.5 million because you haven't been able to hire the managers without your excessive turnover for the product development Is this accurate**  
* **so where I'm a bit lost here Lee is you've had this issue for the first 6 months that you were trying to develop the product You had a deadline You had a D-Day so to speak 6 months get the product out Fix the stagnant growth Have you been doing anything for the last 18 months**  
* **Why now are you reaching out to fix this after you've already lost an extra 4 a.5 million**  
* **why do you think you're struggling to get these managers through the training program at the volume you need without them leaving**  
* **Why do you think that's the issue**  
* **How do you mean**  
* **Why such a big number**  
* **Sorry Sorry Sorry Why such a big number of managers that you need for product development**  
* **What is the deadline for**  
* **has has this customer already paid for this product**  
* **Oh sorry What's what's the contract value of that product for**  
* **And if if the product is delivered to them late what are the financial implications of that quarter of a million price tag**  
* **And how many of these big contracts do you have in regards to is this your only customer so to speak or is this onetenth of your customer customer audience or or how is this in terms of a ratio of if you lose this person for business now and business in the future what chunk of your bis business is that cutting away**  
* **My question Sorry My question is even if they give you two weeks if nothing changes with your ability to hire and secure the right managers to develop the product in the next two weeks you don't think you're going to get it done within two weeks if nothing changes Or did I misunderstand**  
* **Remind me again how much is your business doing currently per year in in revenue**  
* **So this is anywhere from one to $1.5 million that you're going to lose if you don't do something about this right now per year Yeah Because you're going to lose is that accurate because you're going to lose 30 to 50% of your customer base If you don't get this product done on time even with a twoe extension the likelihood is they're going to remove themselves from doing business from you And this is 30 to 50% of your entire customer base Is that accurate**  
* **If you lost 30 to 50% of your business's income do you have enough profit margin that you would not go out of business and bankrupt**  
* **How many years have you put into building this businessly personally**  
* **So when you consider that if you don't fix your human resources issue with hiring the right managers keeping the right managers so you can develop the product you may basically lose 15 years of your entire life building this business if it could go go under when you hear that What's what's going through your mind**  
* **Why is it scary**  
* **You mentioned that you should have got it handled sooner Why do you think you didn't**  
* **So if I'm understanding correctly your discomfort with basically getting the feedback that you need that could could have saved your company from going bankrupt has been something that you've ignored And as a result of that now in your mid4s your entire retirement plan which was building this business after the last 15 years is in jeopardy**  
* **So my question for you is are you at the point now where you're desperate enough to get the feedback you need rather than the feedback you want that you would actually listen to us and do what you need what we tell you you need to do so that you don't potentially lose your company Are you at that point cuz this has been a habit of yours it seems like with all due respect to not want feedback that's constructive but uncomfortable Are you going to break that cycle today**  
* **Can I be direct with you Lee if I give you the feedback that is probably the feedback very similar to what you've been ignoring for the last two years will you ignore it or will you actually change the way you've been ignoring feedback and risking your entire business?**  
* **Is that professional and the type of guy that's keeping their word to themselves and their customers?**  
* **Are you going to be the guy that breaks your word and acts unprofessionally?**  
* **Why not?**  
* **So what would you do if you're professional and you keep your word?**  
* **So what do you choose do you want to be professional and keep your word or do you want to be unprofessional and not keep your word which type of guy do you want to be?**  
* **Well with all the things you've got going on where does this rank in terms of priorities?**  
* **Why number one?**  
* **So can you be honest with me and be honest with yourself why are you now going back to something that we've already discussed?**  
* **So you've got this very big in terms of revenue potential project that you're working on but you're currently down by 10 people to manage the team of people So can I ask you Lee how's it going**  
* **Given that you're down by not 10 people given that you're down by 10 managers how's it going**  
* **stay vague So what's the situation**  
* **tell me more**  
* **So you may potentially not be paid for the work right**  
* **So losing how much that deal was valued at**  
* **And what happens to that money if given that you're already over the deadline it reaches a threshold where that that customer is no longer interested**  
* **Can I ask you directly on a scale of 1 to 10 how close do you think you are to them wanting to ask for it back**  
* **And what is the difference between the eight and the 10 in regards to is it you've got another few days another few weeks is it like what what are your reces as far as that not happening**  
* **Leah are you are you saying that unless something drastic changes that 250,000 is gone**  
* **So correct me if I'm a bit confused here Lee but given that that money is probably already gone what exactly are you looking to get out of this call and working with us**  
* **Why specifically do you think this is your number one attempt**  
* **So if you don't know how it connects what do you want me to do**  
* **Well I mean I appreciate you having so much faith in me Lee but what do you think happens if I'm the one that shows you how to how it connects and you haven't come up with that yourself**  
* **So what do you want to do do you want to go away for 24 hours and come back to me once you've figured it out or do you want to tell me on this call what you think**  
* **And what do what do you think is the likelihood that they give you that leeway and if I caveat the question Lee would you give yourself that leeway if you were the customer**  
* **And so so given that you so given that you wouldn't do that to yourself if you were in their position what do you think the likelihood is that they give it to you**  
* **Why would you not give the company that was your supplier that leeway Why would you not do it**  
* **So correct me if I'm wrong but does that make you the person that doesn't have that level of professionalism and doesn't keep your word to your customers**  
* **How does that make you feel**  
* **What are you going to do about it**  
* **Is that professional and the type of guy that's keeping their word to themselves and their customers**  
* **Are you going to be the guy that breaks your word and acts unprofessionally**  
* **why not**  
* **so what would you do if you're professional and you keep your word**  
* **So what do you choose do you want to be professional and keep your word or do you want to be unprofessional and not keep your word which type of guy do you want to be**  
* **So if you said and if you were in that position where your supplier let you down what would you do**  
* **And now as the CEO of the company how does that make you feel in in that context based on his response and the question**  
* **So what are you going to do**  
* **And so if I can be blunt with you Lee your business is on the line because of your own ignorance Is that accurate**  
* **Given that it's not easy to hear would you like to get off this call and not have to hear it and not have to face it**  
* **And if I hold you accountable to facing your own ignorance through sharing with you what we've got going on over here and potentially also challenging you about some specifics that you need to improve in your communication that will continue to be rather uncomfortable Are you going to get off the call and just not face it**  
* **Why**  
* **I mean your retirement could be a little while away Is there any particular reason that that is a pressing thing right now because you could just retire 2 years later than your expected date I mean why is that a big deal**  
* **You said if I don't change my communication style that's a repercussion certainly that you need to fix But what it is that you need to change is your ignorance over your own leaks Specifically in this case your communication style Is that a fair clarification**  
* **How many more days do you want to be showing up with a level of ignorance knowing that you could have solved this 6 months ago maybe you had comments before that And now your business is on the line your retirement is on the line your growth of the business is on the line How many more days are you willing to be ignorant to the feedback that is difficult to hear but what you need to hear**  
* **But have you ever considered I guess more spiritually that if you just simply were a guy that was not ignorant or opposed to people's feedback that universally that might shift a lot of things for you in life and in your business just simply not being that guy that's putting out that frequency of fuck off leave me alone I don't want you to give me feedback Have you ever considered that as well**  
* **Are you ready to fix that**

# Fin Services 2

Here is a list of questions suggested or asked by Josh:

* **can I ask like what do you think is the the cost of that exactly**  
* **what was it uh prior to that when you did 150 to 200**  
* **is this your main bread and butter right now or do you have any other income streams**  
* **just to make sure I'm clear Kevin when you say you lost a little bit of money you know obviously everyone's perspective of money is different but when you've gone from 6 to 7 million down to four to five is is 30% of your money from this business is that a little bit to you**  
* **and when you say you planned to lose revenue was there no opportunity for you to plan to not lose the revenue**  
* **so if you think the market's going to recover in terms of health in the next few years why not just wait for that**  
* **so when you say you have no other options you said you've been looking for other options almost every day for what time period have you been looking for other options**  
* **and during those 12 months you haven't come up with any potential options**  
* **what is the cut off for you in terms of timeline of losing money that you no longer want to lose anymore**  
* **what do you mean with um cut off exactly**  
* **is there a timeline in your mind where you say enough's enough i don't want to lose another dollar and if so what is that timeline**  
* **so if I'm understanding correctly you didn't want to lose any money but you had planned that it was probably going to happen over the last 12 months and the reason that you felt like you didn't have any choices with allowing that money to be lost is you didn't feel like you had any options is that accurate**  
* **and so you've been researching for looking for options for a year you've then come across us what was it that you saw with what we did that made you feel maybe this is an option as far as moving your money into a different financial market**  
* **is there an example of not feeling safe which is why you want to change it**  
* **when you say you know you don't feel like your money's safe safe safe from what safe from what**  
* **when you say that you you your money doesn't feel safe like what do you mean by that**  
* **what don't you trust about Europe**  
* **why don't you trust that**  
* **what happened**  
* **but what I'm not clear on if you could maybe help me understand this is is there some situations or experiences where your money has actually not been safe like something's gone wrong with your money or gone wrong with your finances**  
* **and with your friends that have actually had this happen compared to you how similar is their financial setup you know where their money is how much money they've got compared to yours are you very similar in terms of how you've set up your money to some of these friends of yours**  
* **and so given that it's very similar and you mentioned you're not sleeping well at night your your um your mindset's not where it wants to be if you were to put an estimate on it what would you estimate the likelihood is right now if nothing changes that you could have your bank accounts frozen and lose access to your money if you put it on a as a percentage do you think it's 100% likely it's just a case of when it happens or how how would you**  
* **how much money do you have currently at risk of being locked up and frozen**  
* **and as far as your portion of your net worth or your available money how much of that is it**  
* **how similar is your financial situation to theirs**  
* **if you were to ballpark a percentage how likely is it that you feel this is going to happen to you**  
* **what is the biggest challenge you're having being in your current financial market**  
* **when you say it's not safe not safe in what way**  
* **when you say the market's dog shit what do you mean**  
* **in your opinion what is the biggest challenge you're having with your money**  
* **in your opinion what's your biggest financial challenge in your current financial market right now**  
* **So given that this is a guarantee that it's going to happen what do you think the number one thing is that you need to do right now to lower that chance of that happening**  
* **what do you think your number one option for you going forward is**  
* **and do what with it**  
* **save it where**  
* **so if I'm understanding the number one thing that you have to do so that you don't have a guaranteed uh likelihood that you you lose access to the money is get it out of Europe is that accurate**  
* **how long have you been aware that that's what you need to do**  
* **so why haven't you done it**  
* **and so and so if you did see something that you feel confident that that can happen you can move your money out of Europe how quickly would you move that money**  
* **and so based on what you've already seen from us how confident do you feel that we can be that solution for you**  
* **my question is not the details of the process my question is the principle of what we've shown that you can do you feel 100% confident that that will be the solution for you to get your money out of Europe**  
* **so how much longer do you want to keep your money in Europe instead of going through our process and we'll show you exactly how to do this right now**  
* **how would you want me to guarantee that**  
* **when I see there's a serious process behind how do you define a serious is process**  
* **where do you want to go from here**  
* **do you understand that pieces of those steps are our secret source which is what you would be investing in things that you can't find on Google things that you wouldn't actually find unless you became a client**  
* **is that fair**  
* **what is I guess what is the biggest reason that you need to do something about this right now in regards to how it's affecting you dayto-day you mentioned things like sleeping mindset what what exactly is going on for you right now in terms of the way this is affecting you**  
* **stuck with what**  
* **what impact is not being able to solve this problem having on other things**  
* **what What's going on that your wife's bringing it up**  
* **if if you were to describe the situation you're in holistically in one word or a couple of words how would you describe**  
* **how many more days are you willing to be mentally and physically stuck**  
* **how does tha**  
* **what do you mean yeah very good**  
* **what's stopping you from moving your money out of a situation where it's 100% guaranteed that it's going to get frozen and you're going to lose access to it what's stopping you**  
* **where are you at now after a year of looking in regards to finding options**  
* **with what you've come across with us how do you feel**  
* **logical sense if by the end of this call it still makes logical sense given that you're in a situation where your money is 100% likely to get frozen and you'll lose access to it how quickly would you move the money if what we show you by the end of this call makes sense**  
* **Where do you want to go from here?**  
* **so what's going on Kevin as far as you being in this situation that this needs to be handled other than logically**  
* **If you were to describe your situation in one word how would you feel**  
* **what's going on**  
* **so so you know being in this situation with the wife and being stuck like how do you feel like what's going on**  
* **what's the issue with losing money**  
* **so why aren't you making 600**  
* **so knowing that you're $250,000 below the potential of the business like how do you feel**  
* **what do you mean**  
* **why do you think that is**  
* **if you're okay or somewhat okay with 5K a month what do you think is the likelihood that you actually put in the work and commit and invest and get a mentor and make the personal changes to get to 20K a month**  
* **so do you think the reason that you haven't accomplished this is because the likelihood of it happening is so low because you haven't actually got fired up about having to get to the next level of income**  
* **how long or how much longer are you willing to not get fired up about the fact that you're not making the money that you want to make which is what needs to change as the input so you get to the output**

# RE wholesale

Here is a transcript of questions suggested or asked by Josh (and only Josh) when playing the salesperson or suggesting questions a salesperson should ask:

* **Is that all accurate?**  
* **Is that clear?**  
* **Is that accurate too?**  
* **How much exactly did you take home last month?**  
* **Why in your mind is that just decent?**  
* **Is that typically an average income you bring in every single month?**  
* **Where does that money come from Bart is that a fixed salary is that commission how do you get paid?**  
* **How long has your salary been 8K a month?**  
* **What exactly did you make last month?**  
* **How is that structured is that a fixed salary do you get commission bonuses how does that work?**  
* **How long has have you been um I guess just at decent money at 8K a month?**  
* **Is that like um a typical salary that you're just making on a month-to-month basis with that job?**  
* **How long have you been earning that amount of money per month in the business?**  
* **What would you say is the biggest reason that you want to get into wholesale real estate right now?**  
* **Did I get all that right?**  
* **Did I get that right?**  
* **Is that correct?**  
* **If I'm clear all of your friends are doing wholesale real estate and they are doing this thing which is giving them this lifestyle Is that accurate?**  
* **Why aren't you just doing exactly what they're doing?**  
* **So why aren't you doing it now?**  
* **And they're all doing wholesale real estate Did I get that correct?**  
* **So why aren't you doing it?**  
* **How badly do you want the girls, the travel, the boats?**  
* **Why?**  
* **You sound like you're pretty conflicted Is that accurate?**  
* **So what are you going to do?**  
* **If you're not sure what led you to booking this call?**  
* **How long have you wanted that?**  
* **Are you at the point where you're no longer willing to not go after what you truly want?**  
* **Why what changed?**  
* **Why do you need coaching or mentorship or a training or a course?**  
* **Was there any particular reason you booked in a call if you've got access to your friends?**  
* **Why do you want to learn with us?**  
* **Why don't you just go and learn from them?**  
* **What's your offer?**  
* **How much money are you making?**

* **So when you say you make decent money it's also fixed Is that accurate?**  
* **So how long has it been stuck at just 8K?**

# Trading Offer

* any particular reason you don't just carry on with what you're doing that's led to things picking up?  
* is there any particular reason you don't just play out whatever it is that you've been working on to get slightly better results?  
* 5 minutes or 15 minutes ago you said blank why are you now saying this?  
* have you gained experience in the last 20 minutes?  
* so what's changed?  
* what do you think is the likelihood that you make more than 10K in the next 30 days?  
* so do you want to invest 10K to have a very high likelihood that you make 10K a month or more consistently month after month not saying you'll never have a bad month but in general you're going to be up or do you want to go and have a 0% chance that you hit 10K again?  
* Did I put any of those words in your mouth?  
* what would you disagree with or what would you change?  
* over 8 months are you clear on exactly where you're at in terms of break even at a loss or made money?  
* why did you start trading again?  
* why did you not just quit?  
* on a daily basis ballparking the number how many hours do you spend?  
* and is there any time you're spending not executing on trading?  
* when you hear that how does that make you feel?  
* what about that is depressing?  
* given that it's been a waste of time money and effort why after the hiatus did you get back into trading?  
* what led to that?  
* what was the reason for that?  
* why haven't you been able to capitalize on this opportunity?  
* why do you think you haven't been able to capitalize on this opportunity?  
* why not?  
* so what would be?  
* why haven't you got that?  
* what's different now?  
* but why do you need to do this?  
* so why us?  
* what do you mean by solid?  
* what does she mean by that?  
* so if I'm understanding correctly you believe that anything on YouTube free content is not going to have that solidarity is that accurate?  
* what impact do you think not having that solidarity has had on your results?  
* so are you saying that if you did have solidarity of a real human being that's working with you personally and training you and coaching you with a community of people that are at your level going to the next level you think you would have had the solidarity you need to actually get these results?  
* have you gotten to the point where you're no longer willing to waste time on a nonsolid way of learning trading by just watching free content on YouTube?  
* why now?  
* so why not continue to just watch more YouTube then?  
* do you think the solidarity that you're looking for to get the results that you want is out there in free content on YouTube Melik?  
* why not?  
* when did you have that realization?  
* so if that's not solid what would be solid?  
* so what are you going to do keep watching non-solid YouTube content flushing money time and effort down the drain or actually getting access solidarity from training courses mentorships what are you going to do?  
* what is it about the YouTube content that you have been watching for the last eight months that you feel isn't solid?  
* given that this is your hard-earned money you don't want to waste it you have been wasting it what do you think is the most sensible thing you can do with some of your hard-earned money to ensure that you're actually safely going to multiply it?  
* what do you think?  
* why do you say that?  
* how about YouTube?  
* why so what would be sensible?  
* who do you want to mentor you?  
* why Brad?  
* does that make sense?  
* why does that make sense?  
* how's that going for you?  
* what about if you had $2,000 left but you knew I'm placing this money into an investment that I know I understand I've been trained on I've been guided on I've got a mentor that showed me what to do?  
* so what do you want to do?  
* what what about watching YouTube has not been solid enough?  
* and do you think that you would be able to find the step-by-step plan the emotional guidance the personal plan on YouTube?  
* So how certain do you think that you're going to find the step-by-step personalized layout on YouTube?  
* so Melik given that you've been looking on YouTube for eight months now after eight months of trying to find something step by step personalized and well laid out what is your belief that you're going to find that on YouTube?  
* and so what do you need to do to no longer waste 8 months?  
* so what are you going to do?  
* so what is your plan?  
* Okay so you booked in the call why?  
* So you mentioned due diligence what do you mean by that?  
* when you say you've done your due diligence what do you mean you've already completed that?  
* how certain are you that we're the people that you want to go with?  
* is there any part of you that wants to try out anybody else's methodology before you commit to a mentor or a trainer?  
* what made you want to start trading in the first place?  
* why did you even get into trading in the first place?  
* why does this even matter to you?  
* to what level does it matter?  
* what's going on in your life why you need to master this?  
* so what is that motivation for you?  
* what about the time you're spending or not spending with your 2-year-old daughter is is sad for you?  
* so if you're not present what are you right now?  
* so what are you?  
* so what's going on?  
* so what's going on right now?  
* so what's going on with your daughter?  
* what do you think's happening?  
* why do you think that?  
* what images are going through your head?  
* how does that make you feel?  
* what if you crashed your car because you're thinking about all of these painful things on your way to work?  
* So what's actually going on at home with your daughter?  
* what makes you believe that?  
* and so when the nanny told you for the for the last three months your daughter's been crying every single day what what did you feel?  
* How did what make her feel?  
* and how did her telling you that the your baby is grumpy all the time that you're gone make you feel?  
* so what's the solution Melik?  
* what would be the specific number you have to reach to quit your job and essentially give your daughter back her peace?  
* how does 5K a month compare with what you've seen our students accomplish?  
* so how does that make you feel knowing that that's conservative?  
* and how does that feel knowing that you want to be conservative with your money that's your hard-earned money and now you've seen that working with us that would be a conservative goal?  
* why is that powerful?  
* how does that make you feel in relation to your willingness and commitment to invest your hard-earned money let's say compared to if you were looking to accomplish something by investing your hard-earned money with a goal that was possible with something else but a stretch how does it make you feel in regards to making this decision?  
* and so what does that do to your certainty and decisiveness to be able to make this investment?  
* how long has this been going on for?  
* was it affecting you in any way?  
* did you have any thoughts feelings imaginations of things before you found out?

* so for for how long have you been having these bad feelings of being a bad mom?  
* what impact if any if anything has it been having on the other areas of your life?  
* so when you say you don't have a social life what's actually going on?  
* so combining all this together M like daytoday for you how is it?  
* how much longer are you willing to have your own heart broken and your daughter's heart broken in every single area of your life because you haven't been able to get the step-by-step personalized laidout plan for how to master trading and make $5,000 a month which as you said is an extremely conservative goal given the results you've seen from us that you've already done your due diligence on?  
* how many more days are you willing to drive out of the house in the car crying knowing that not only are you putting your daughter in this unpieful situation where she's grumpy but also you're not figuring out a solution?  
* your situation is actually going to get even worse is that accurate?  
* So how so how are you going to feel tomorrow when you step in the car start driving burst into tears and know that your daughter's at home grumpy?  
* would you like to think about it when you're balling your eyes out in the car tomorrow or would you like to get in the car tomorrow which is going to happen in less than 12 hours knowing that whether you cry or not you are fixing and resolving the situation?  
* what are you going to do?  
* so tomorrow you're willing to get in your car crying not only crying because your daughter's not peaceful and she's now grumpy but crying as well because you know today right now in this moment you didn't fix that situation you actually backed down you you you know cowarded away you let your fear run your decisions and you chose to be selfish rather than caring and putting your daughter first is that genuinely what you're willing to do?

# Taxes offer

* in your opinion what is the biggest challenge that you're having with your current taxes right now  
* okay I noticed you you took a big sigh there why is that  
* do you remember how much the last tax bill was that you handed over to the government  
* and how many years have you handed that over so to speak  
* when you say significant chunks has it been different in the first 2 3 4 years compared to now or has it been around about that number every year  
* so 3040 for a few years then it's been around 100 and then what's meant that it's now gone to 120 150 you know 50 50% increase  
* and with how things are right now is that number fairly consistent or is it starting to go up on the rise  
* has something changed as to why given that it's staying consistent you no longer are willing to hand that money over anymore  
* are you working harder than you were because you said that that in congruence between how hard you're working versus the money you're handing over was a big deal or is there another type of change  
* you specifically  
* who's paying for them to be put up  
* with whose money  
* which is whose  
* how do you feel about that  
* why don't you just go live somewhere else  
* so your life is here but you don't l ike the way the government are essentially giving the money that you're handing over to house people that are creating hatred against you conflict against your you know just your your lifestyle I guess is that accurate  
* has there been any incidents with this situation where it's become something that you need to resolve now as opposed to just something you see on the news  
* what do you feel specifically  
* and just clarify for me what's the reason you're struggling to do that right now what's the challenge with just going and buying a bigger house  
* could you afford it without changing your tax  
* so it's either settle for a house that isn't really what you want or it's you need to leverage essentially cash from money that you're literally handing over every year anyway is that accurate  
* just out of curiosity where do you think you would stand or what what do you think you would be doing if you were still in the situation where you want the bigger house it's going to cost you more money obviously but the money that you were giving away to tax was going away to good things but let's say they were building good schools and things like that where where would you stand then  
* my question is more would you just grow your business and make more money or would you still at that point be looking to regain the tax money that you're handing over  
* how long have you wanted this house then  
* sorry say again 18 months is that what you said  
* on a scale of 1 to 10 how much of a priority is it to get this house now 10 being we literally need to move into this house ASAP zero being it's a nice to h ave but it's not essential five h  
* how do you feel about that number given what you already know about entrepreneurship business people doing things that are a five out of 10  
* so what what do you want me to do  
* let me ask you a question where was the importance when you booked in this call was it a five out of 10 or was there something bubbling over  
* do you think that emotional situation is going to happen again  
* on that day when you got mad did it impact your business did it impact your work did it impact your day with your wife with your kids did it have any impact  
* what did you do  
* Is it serious what you're trying to get over like is it hey we don't like paint on the walls or not paint on the walls you know she's firmly in charge of that  
* but my question is is it something that if this continues to happen you might be on the path for a divorce or is it hey we're just not going to have sex for a few days  
* what level of importance do you think it needs to be on a scale of 1 to 10 for you to find the way and actually take action on the way  
* you really don't like Trudeau do you  
* does your wife have any opinions on this  
* what do you mean scary  
* Can you do that right now could you just get on a plane and move over there if you needed to  
* when is some point what like what's the timeline on that  
* do you have any foothold in in any type of process currently to get that accomplished  
* do you want to leave Canada like forget about logistically it's possible when it's possible do you want to leave Canada  
* how certain are you you could persuade her  
* do you want to persuade her like is is that something you want to do in terms of you want to be the one behind persuading her that you pack up everything you move to USA and I don't that's not a trick question i'm I'm not saying hey you're a bad person for persuading your wife i'm just curious is you want to move she's a little bit unsure but do you want to be the one that leads that decision to Okay  
* and and if you could just click your fingers when would you move out of Canada  
* why wouldn't you move everything there tomorrow if you could just click your fingers and it's all done there was nothing for you to do  
* so aside from logistically going through the process you don't want to be in Canada anymore you would rather just be somewhere else  
* is that accurate  
* is there anything going on in your business in your life you mentioned stuff with your marriage that's having you a little bit undecided on things  
* i'm I'm getting the vibe of like you're not so sure what you want right  
* so how do you want to navigate this do you want to think about it do you want to come back tomorrow do you want to make a decision right now like what do you want to do  
* okay that's enough for you  
* is that enough your client  
* how old are you now  
* how many hours would you be willing to carve out on a weekly basis to work with us to set this up to save in the short term around about 70,000 within the next 12 months in the longer term to not be giving your money away to people that you don't want to to be able to get access to that additional capital for the house to have a option to leave what would be the amount of time that you'd be willing to carve out and I when I say carve out I mean like starting tomorrow like how much time would you carve out to work with us to build this  
* did I put you off  
* is this the right fit  
* what was the specific moment that led you to booking this call was there was there one thing was that the thing you saw on the news the other day  
* how much you paying your accountant  
* how much you paying him  
* And what percentage tax did he get you to  
* so do you want to go away and like do your own research as far as try and make yourself more aware or do you want someone to just lead you to what to do and how to do it and tell you to do it now  
* why'd you pick that  
* having this conversation with me what's your intuition tell you do you feel like you can trust me do you feel like you can trust us to just take care of this for you  
* are you Jewish  
* so what do you want to do  
* is that something that you're or how do you feel currently about that position that I just laid out  
* what do you mean do we have reference  
* are we good at what we do is that what you're asking  
* just do you think that you would want us to give you out to be our salesperson and hand out where you're currently set up and you know what your banking system is and how much we've saved you in tax would you want us to do that for you  
* no is that a Is that a a deal breaker for you if we're not willing to share our client's private information with you  
* what you sure you're not yours Josh like you got a lot of trust with me right now what What changed  
* just out of curiosity what do you think it would do for you and for your business to start working with people that you can trust  
* sorry what's the missing piece  
* in what way  
* is there anything we haven't covered  
* how you feeling  
* do you need a minute  
* what were you thinking about what was kind of going through your mind  
* Can I ask you a personal question  
* you remember a minute ago maybe 20 minutes ago you were talking about you had some stuff going on with your wife how much of how much of that do you think has been caused or exacerbated because you have all of these bricks over you  
* how do you think it's affecting her  
* when let's say at the end of this call we we decide hey let's let's get this cracking which it sounds like we will but I you know I don't like to just assume things and at the end of this call you can kind of wipe your hands and say this part of my life is now taken care of the house the taxes the emotional duress from it how do you think you'll show up to your wife when you get home  
* what impact do you think that will have on her  
* but ultimately whose choice is it how much longer you choose to carry all of these bricks  
* how much longer are you going to carry these bricks weighing yourself down and weighing the people around you down  
* why not  
* how does that make you feel  
* I think we've covered everything do you have anything else that you want to share  
* do you want me to walk you through the steps of us taking this off your plate

# Relationship Offer

* all right Matt how you doing  
* so you ready to go ahead and get rolling  
* are you sure  
* what would you say is the biggest challenge that you're having in your marriage right now  
* give me an example of one of the most critical things that you're not on the same page on right now  
* okay and where do things stand now between you and your wife  
* and so where are things with you and your wife now in regards to has one of you moved out have you broken up like  
* you mean in the same bed or do you mean sexually  
* how's that for you  
* is that is that all accurate so far  
* what else if anything are you not on the same page on or is it just this  
* give me one example of something very significant that you you see things differently regarding raising your kids  
* just one sec what's your job  
* what's your wife's job  
* does she bring in any income  
* and how soon into the relationship did she become a stay-at-home mom  
* and whose decision was that  
* why didn't you say that to her  
* do you have a conflict  
* do you have an internal conflict do you have a spiritual conflict do you have a personal conflict in any way shape or form do you feel conflicted  
* Well is it is it is it is it small be honest with yourself be honest with me are we on this call cuz cuz this conflict in how your relationship is and how your setup is as a parent and how your life is as Matt versus how you want it to be the difference between those is is it small  
* but like how long have you been trying to minimize it  
* how is it going for you trying to minimize it  
* is it working  
* do you think you will solve the problem if you continue to minimize it  
* is that a common tendency of yours  
* you mean like to not to not deal with things or to deny things to repress them to not face conflict head on to not face challenges head on is that something that you generally struggle with  
* is there any part of you that views your wife as not a normal person  
* Has she has she expressed to you either literally or through alternative words or phrases that that's something necessary for her for her children  
* do you think you two are compatible enough that both of you and your children can have a stable and peaceful situation for everybody given the the large differences between you and your wife  
* if I got your wife on the phone and I asked her the same question what do you feel she would say about our compatibility  
* so then the question is why hasn't it been doable thus far  
* what do you not know what's going on about what  
* what about your leadership have you not been good at in this marriage  
* am I wrong  
* in general who blows up first  
* when you're in a discussion who is the first person to either shut down or blow up  
* if we took 20 of these interactions how many of those was it you that reacted in the wrong way either shutting down or blowing up first  
* over the last 7 to 8 years again be very honest with yourself how many times if ever has it crossed your mind that this is all your fault  
* how much of the fact that this has lasted seven to eight years do you think is because of that  
* would that have been the one thing that was enough to lead to this having been wiped off the face of the earth this this problem between you and your wife  
* but correct me if I'm wrong if you'd have taken full ownership that those situations were now no longer bad luck but your fault how would you have approached them differently to how you have done the last four years  
* why don't I just apply those business things to my marriage  
* does that make sense  
* do you still want to be passive  
* why did it take you so long to answer  
* what has it done to your wife  
* have you got a piece of paper there  
* you got a pen  
* what has it done to you  
* why why does that bother you  
* how accurate on a scale of 1 to 10 is it that it was your passiveness and your lack of taking responsibility and ownership over the way you have been a leader that has resulted in that version of Matt the authentic version of you being killed  
* what is the biggest negative that you see your kids having to go through in their life right now in relation to you being angry you not being peaceful your wife and you not being affectionate  
* does that make sense  
* what's another day gonna do  
* what's different if you got off this call now and you don't do anything about it compared to yesterday compared to before this call  
* what's the difference  
* what is going to be different in in the way that you're going to be maybe viewing this if you don't do anything about it right now  
* is anything going to have changed  
* do you think you can do that on your own without our help  
* why is that  
* would that be taking full ownership and no longer being passive to move forward today knowing that you already don't know what to do  
* would it be passive to to get off this call to say that you're going to take responsibility but know full well that you don't know what to do is that active or is that passive in regards to fixing this problem and being a leader  
* do you want to go away and take as long as you think that would be to get to that point or do you want to avoid that point altogether and decide to actually fix this properly starting today  
* why Why not just go away and see how far you can get on your own  
* do you think we can help you to do this if you paid us  
* why is that  
* at this point do you have enough in you Matt to get past that apathy now step up do what you need to do pull the trigger take the action get stuck in  
* how certain are you that that hope is going to get you the result that you want  
* is there anything that we haven't covered yet  
* did you have something to say  
* you okay  
* what happens next  
* how does that sound  
* where do you want to go from here  
* why am I not  
* do you do anything productive for the other 30 minutes  
* do you think I could fake the energy that I was in on that role play or the one yesterday or any of the role plays  
* do you think I could just pretend to be that switched on

* Okay that makes sense  
* So you were kind of thinking about would this be a good thing would this not be a good thing where are you at now where are you at now where's your mindset at now what's your thoughts at now  
* Okay you've booked in a sales call So what made you sure now that you do want to do this  
* okay so I'm curious what's going on with your lead genen right now that means it does seem now is the time to move forward on this AI  
* what's going on with your lead gen that means now is it seems the time to move forward with AI  
* What's goi ng on in regards to lead genen which is your lead genen or your client's lead gen Okay That means now's the time that you're looking to move forward on AI  
* What's going on with your lead gen that means you're now moving forward on this AI that you've been considering for a blank period of time  
* Okay got it So um you want to grow faster you want to scale So in regards to your growth and scale last month how many leads did you get  
* okay so in regards to your growth and the speed that you're scaling right now what was your revenue last month  
* how many bought  
* how many did you sell how many closed  
* How many bought  
* Why do you think the other seven didn't  
* So just to clarify do you think they were good leads  
* So so are you saying you want leads that are in a worse position in terms of that they're really struggling and therefore there's more of a pain point to buy your stuff  
* why why are you not growing enough  
* Why is that not enough growth right now  
* What is that not enough growth for  
* oh interesting  
* how do you feel about that  
* interesting Why did you bring that up  
* and and what's the vision look like right now  
* What do you see  
* Well okay Well you say you don't know what's going to happen Correct me if I'm wrong but there's images in your head of what is going to happen if nothing changes So what are those envisions in your brain right now  
* with the business how it is now and the lack of growth at the pace that you want it to grow Will you make it work  
* why  
* in what way would it not work  
* So why if you do do you feel like AI is the way to scale your business so that you can make it work with your newborn on the way  
* Okay why AI  
* How much is your wife earning  
* how much is your wife making  
* with the current way that your business is or isn't growing and scaling are you going to have covered that shortfall within 5 months  
* have you planned a budget for how much extra money you're going to need when the newborn arrives  
* Okay well when you had your other baby how much did your household expenses go up by  
* So that's $11,000  
* How many months or years do you plan on your wife not being at work  
* Let's just say you know it's not forever How long would you say it would be that she's going to be off work  
* When you hear that number how do you feel  
* Why is it frustrating  
* Just for my clarity what is it about the number that's frustrating  
* Are you going to be able to cover it with the current rate that the business is scaling growing if nothing changes  
* Why'd you say definitely not  
* So just so I'm clear are you telling me and telling yourself that with the setup you have right now of the business the the lack of growth in 12 months plus the extra five uh plus the extra 6 months to have the baby So in 18 months because this 131,000 is money that you're going to need This is not to go on a holiday this is just for you to live that you're essentially going to have a debt of 131,000 cuz you're going to have to get that money from somewhere So it's going to be a loan credit cards somewhere So if nothing changes are you saying that that's just going to have been a debt  
* Imagining that 18 months from now you have three kids I think he said three Three kids a wife and a debt of $131,000 How's that feel  
* Do you think your wife's thinking about it  
* You you're talking about you My question was do you think your wife is thinking about it  
* What do you think she's thinking knowing that she's got a baby inside of her she's three months pregnant Her husband hasn't figured out how to provide and support for the kids for the family when she has to stop working What do you think she's thinking  
* Do you agree with that  
* How's that make you feel  
* How much longer are you going to put it off  
* Do you think your wife's scared  
* If you if you had a baby inside of you you knew you were bringing another life into the world You already had two other kids You knew that your husband hasn't figured out how to take care of you and the kids Would you be scared  
* So how do you think she's feeling  
* The question I have for you is what are you doing still sitting on the outside are you someone who's going to continue to just watch free content when deep down you know being on the inside being mentored by me directly being around other unicorn closers is the thing that would take you to the next level  
* If you think you're getting value from the free content I'm putting out here on YouTube what do you think happens inside the mastermind  
* So the question is how much longer are you going to delay kick the can down the road and procrastinate on the thing that's going to take you to the next level so you can earn more money in sales

# Business Scaling

* you ready to go ahead and get rolling  
* so i'm curious in your opinion what is the biggest challenge that you're having growing your videography business right now  
* is that accurate  
* so let's break that down then in the last month when you say inconsistency unreliable how's things been the last month  
* okay why did you laugh when you said like that was a high school shoot  
* okay so these high school shoots they're not real money makers  
* how much did you get paid for that gig  
* what about editing and things like that post-prouction anything there  
* you didn't charge for that  
* did you do that work you you spent the extra two two and a half hours doing all of that or or no  
* do you have a lot of money coming in from this business  
* so how many total hours did you spend on that project  
* what about traveling there and back how long did that take you  
* what price point are you seeing is is potentially out there for you if you knew how to secure it  
* maybe for how many hours  
* what about the month before how much total did you bring in for your business on the videography last month  
* and how many hours did you work total just ballpark the number the total amount of driving driving back shooting editing how many hours was that  
* and one more month before that what was that in terms of how much money did you make from the business and if you want to you can also give me how many hours you worked  
* why  
* does that make sense  
* is that is that accurate  
* why in fact let me ask you this question how long now have you been running this videography business  
* through that entire year has it been more or less the same that you've had inconsistency unreliability and not been making any significant money  
* so then my question is why if you do do you need to get this figured out so you can have consistency reliability and make more money in the videography  
* how much do you make a month from your 9 to5 videography  
* and then after your expenses how much do you have left after tax after expenses how much does that leave you with a month  
* is that what it left you with last month  
* well no just just to make sure we're on the same page i'm talking about your 9 to5 your 9 to5 videography you said you make $3,500 a month is that accurate  
* what was your expenses last month  
* understood let's go deeper into this sick of working for others what exactly are you sick of in your work for somebody else which i assume is your 9 to5 videography  
* i'm curious so if i'm hearing you correctly you are telling me and this is not a trick question that you believe you're worth more is that accurate  
* so why then when it comes to you charging yourself out as a videographer do you have a challenge of charging more if you say you're worth more where's the because there's like a contradiction here in on one hand you're worth more but on another hand you think you're not  
* but if i'm hearing you correctly deep inside do you believe or do you believe that you are worth more than what you're charging  
* and do you do you believe that you're worth more than working a 9 to5 and someone else controlling your hours and your schedule  
* so how does it feel to believe so deeply in both fronts that you're worth more but not actually getting more  
* tell me really what's going on  
* help what out  
* post the chat here is there something going on between your girlfriend and you with the financial situation that you're bringing to the table or or we could say not bringing to the table  
* i'm curious is is this idea that you're worth more coming from your girlfriend or is it coming from you  
* would we be on this call would you have just been working your 9 to5 doing your passion project videography on the side and everything would have been fine  
* is it in other words is it because of your girlfriend that you've got this conflict of i need to level up or is that a real thing that you have inside of you  
* have you ever reached out for coaching mentorship some type of business opportunity to make more money in the past  
* when when was that  
* what about like way back like two years ago three years ago  
* how much money how much money did you make from the things that any of those courses were teaching you  
* why why do you think that is  
* where do you think you're at now in terms of let's just simply call it commitment to follow through on something compared to where you were back then  
* why  
* when when did you start having these thoughts that something needs to change  
* and so if you if you thought that things needed to change a whole year ago why then have you not had any significant jumps in the consistency and the reliability and charging more in this business over the last year why haven't you figured that out  
* what now has triggered you to need to seek guidance  
* did you say that you're going to get let go in 30 days from your job  
* when you say probably are you saying probably regarding the timeline or probably you'll get let go as in maybe you won't get let go which part's probably  
* so is is there a connecting dot with all of this that is gonna just like boom paint the picture for me so i can understand your situation or or is this  
* considering most people have a job and most people have kids that's the average person why if you do or why if you can't can you not do that from your job  
* would that be enough for you to bring a child into the world  
* what are you doing still sitting on the outside  
* are you someone who's going to continue to just watch free content when deep down you know being on the inside being mentored by me directly being around other unicorn closers is the thing that would take you to the next level  
* if you think you're getting value from the free content i'm putting out here on youtube what do you think happens inside the mastermind  
* okay why now do you want a family all of a sudden what's what's triggered that  
* i'm not clear on what this what what strategy were you following when it comes to putting it off to go and make more money what what strategy were you following  
* what massive action have you taken in lie of putting off having the family to go and make the money have you done anything dramatically different  
* is there something i'm missing  
* how do you feel in regards to your likelihood of being successful in something that with respect you haven't been successful in thus far if nothing significant has changed  
* what would you do in my position  
* what would be the ethical thing that you would do if you were in my shoes to try and help the person out  
* so can you help me help you out by sharing that information with me if there is anything there cuz i'm trying to help you but i need you to help me help you  
* where if at all has the have these things all come to a head or maybe there's another thing we haven't talked about that really was the the straw that broke the camel's back as they say there  
* do you want to talk about it or do you want to leave it as a potential source of motivation for you to accomplish this that you don't want to i guess use as a silver lining from a bad experience it's up to you i'm not going to make you talk about it if you don't want to  
* can you share why that has specifically motivated you to now get serious about investing in scaling your business  
* can can you help me understand why that's motivated you to essentially want to go after a untapped potential inside of you that you haven't gone after for so long  
* why did it have that impact in that direction for you  
* can you tell me a bit more  
* is that accurate  
* so let me ask you this then given that this is so so meaningful for you and such a significant thing why have you chosen us that you believe we're the people to ensure that you accomplish something so significant by way of building the videography business so you can have a family so you know you can follow through on your legacy with with your mom being able to witness that  
* and what specifically do you feel that you need from us to help you get to a place of consistency reliability charging higher prices and ultimately just having way more clients so you can earn way more money what what are the kind of if you gave me two to four things what what do you feel that you need from us  
* are you in a position where you can carve out the time to go through the trainings and the coachings that we're going to give you to scale the business do you have time available or time that you would be willing to carve out to do that  
* how many hours a week can you carve out for us to show you how to scale your business and and make more money  
* how does your girlfriend come into this situation in regards to i assume she knows the the stuff that's going on with your mom does she know  
* but i'm curious where does things stand with your girlfriend in regards to you investing the money and the time to scale the business so that you can have a family with her so that you can do that with your mom still around like what's her i guess level of awareness of this whole thing  
* does she know that you've had like a a turning point of when the things started to happen with your mom two months ago you decided i i'm actually going to take the action now that i haven't been taking for for years does does has she witnessed and experienced that shift in you or is this like a you're just going to go and do this and give her a happy surprise when you come home one day and say "hey i made 10 grand this month."  
* so you don't need her permission to give her that surprise because then it wouldn't be a surprise would  
* is it 100% your money that you'll be investing or do you have like a joint bank account that you'll be using some of her money to make this investment  
* is there a timeline on the situation with your mom that you have to get this accomplished by  
* do you feel it's something that and again i know this is a really difficult conversation ben so i i i genuinely apologize but we have to have an honest conversation is it like she could have a few months but i want to make sure i even started this process while i had the few months so so i feel like i've morally done the right thing or is it a case of she's in a bad way but she kind of got 5 years left and so you definitely have more than enough time to scale the business have the kids your mom has a few years with them like just on those two very extreme ends of probably the second one to go closer one  
* i know that was long but is that is that accurate  
* is there anything i missed  
* is there anything that i twisted or changed that wasn't resonating with you as as being accurate or or correct or  
* how do you feel in terms of seeing how everything has connected together for you and and what that means for you moving forward  
* where do you want to go from here  
* how can we work together is that what you would like to do you'd like us to fix this together and make sure that you can scale the business have a family and accomplish that with whatever time and hopefully as much time as possible that you have with your mom  
* you want me to walk you through simple a through to z how we do that i'll answer any questions you've got and then at that point we can go ahead and get you enrolled  
* does that make sense

# Dating

* How many women are you getting that are exactly what you want to go on a date with?  
* are we talking Jeremy about inefficiency or are we talking about you're still not getting the results you want regardless of how much time you spend  
* out of those 80 dates you haven't been on one with a woman who was exactly what you wanted  
* how many of those women did you think prior to going on the date this could be exactly what I'm looking for  
* is that accurate  
* where is your decision now for the strategy that you want to employ moving forward  
* is that accurate  
* if this has been your your approach for the last 3 to four months Jeremy I'm curious is there any particular reason you don't want to continue the take massive action going on as many dates as possible with women that are not really what you want with the hope that you might get laid approach  
* okay interesting and what was going on right now with your current way of approaching dating that meant that spoke to you  
* is is is that what you want to continue doing or are we on this call because there's another side to dating that you want to shift over to  
* are you doing this to get laid or are you doing this cuz you want a real relationship  
* is it accurate that you just want to be going on the minimalist date possible to potentially lead to sex  
* what do you want  
* hm interesting i'm curious Jeremy if you truly want this 10 out of 10 partner this this woman for something longterm how much do you think those women want to hook up and by hookup I mean a relationship with the guy that you're currently showing up as that's just having sex with as many random girls you can get along the way to finding them  
* how badly do you think they would want that guy  
* is that type of guy that attracts those type of women and enchants those women the guy that is currently just trying to run through as many numbers as possible 100 to one to be able to get hopefully some random sex along the way  
* do you think perhaps part of the problem with you getting to this ultimate long-term relationship is that you're still willing to settle for something that is significantly less than that  
* are you at the point and you can absolutely say no where you want to cut away from the type of dating the lowquality dating and the unintentional dating in terms of compared to your real goal that you've been doing up until now are you at that point  
* which comes first does someone invest in the tools the training the identity work for something that they're not ready uh that they're not yet fully committed to or does someone randomly find the tools and then get good at something and then all of a sudden they are now committed which one comes first  
* why are you at that point where you no longer want to invest any more time money effort into the type of dating that you've been doing up until now  
* i'm not clear on why you being 46 is any different to 45 if that's the reason  
* i'm curious you said that you walked away from what for you was was good it was good from the physical side it was good from the friendship side what eventually led to you walking away from that then if it was good  
* so correct me if I'm putting the tea tea leaves together correctly here Jeremy or or sorry incorrectly even though you had this friendship and this um physical relationship with this last uh partner it sounds like and it and it was good it sounds like there is something inside of you that deeply wants a more connected relationship cooking together living together things like that is that accurate is that a deep-seated Yes  
* have you ever had that  
* have you ever truly found what you deeply want in a relationship  
* how long were you married where you thought it was deeply what you wanted  
* how does that make you feel  
* i'm I'm getting the sense and tell me if I'm wrong you're you're quite blocked from this like I I really don't want to put words in your mouth and say that you're sad if you're not so please correct me if I'm wrong but I'm getting the feeling like this is actually deeply affecting you but the way that you're verbalizing it is is very I don't know the right words but like cold kind of like yeah yeah yeah it's bad as in I don't feel like you're really opening up about it and I'm curious if that's the problem as to why you haven't got this fixed maybe you've like truly wanted this but because it hasn't happened you've you've compressed it and compressed it and compressed it  
* are you asking me how do I know I'm not asking the quote unquote leading questions because I want the prospect to go the direction I want them to not

# Trading

* What's the missing piece of data at least the most important piece from 20 to 4K  
* How long he's been on this account for  
* How can you dig the pain in more  
* What is another thing you could do and you could do both  
* Why if it is is this urgent given that you've still got 75% of the account left  
* Is that why this time around even though he's only just starting to go down he wants to be more proactive  
* What's a word that you could say that's more painful  
* how much money I spent getting those accounts  
* What's the next piece of data that's missing off of that  
* what happens if you lose that last account  
* what is the significance of this being your last account  
* why does this matter  
* why are you doing trading  
* can't you just buy another four  
* can't you just get four accounts from someone else  
* is this like the end of his life or the end of his trading career forever if he burns through four accounts  
* Couldn't you just buy four more then  
* Why not  
* what's another layer that you can go off the back of how much did you pay for the accounts  
* how much total has he paid so far across the 10 months  
* What's the difference cuz it's not his money  
* And what was the payment structure of that was that paid all in one shot up front or did you pay that over the 10 months  
* Where did that money come from  
* Did he give gift you the money or or how did you get the money so to speak  
* And how much did you get total  
* have you what have you done with the rest of that money  
* Why  
* how much did you pay for the accounts did you pay that in monthly installments  
* where did the money come from  
* What's a better way of asking that  
* how's it going  
* And when you say the money is not enough what opportunity do you have as a carpenter to to increase your income as a carpenter  
* So aside from you starting your whole own business and doing marketing and building a brand and all of that your income is is stuck It's not going to go any higher Is that what you're telling me  
* How long's it been stuck  
* What opportunities do you have to increase your income  
* Do you have any interest in starting a carpentry business  
* The question I have for you is what are you doing still sitting on the outside  
* are you someone who's going to continue to just watch free content when deep down you know being on the inside being mentored by me directly being around other unicorn closers is the thing that would take you to the next level  
* what do you think happens inside the mastermind  
* why why now why us how much longer  
* what do you need what are you missing  
* How badly does it suck  
* why does it suck  
* what impact does it have on sucking  
* why do you want to do something different moving forward  
* So what was the reason that 10 months ago you took 15% of the money that you'd got from your granddad and you invested $85,000 of it upfront into trading why did you do that  
* Why did you invest an $85,000 upfront investment from money that you received from your grandfather  
* I'm curious what the reason is Sam aside from what you've already told me that you wanted to get out your 9 to5 that when you got this 125 $120,000 you decided to reinvest it in yourself and trying to learn a skill as opposed to doing what most people would do which is you know go on a holiday to kind of drown themselves out of the fact that they hate their 9 to5 Why why did you make the decision that you did  
* Why is that interesting  
* So I'm very curious Sam why did you make that decision  
* so if I'm hearing you correctly Sam your intention is to take that $120,000 and to invest it in whatever you need to invest it in to build a lifetime of financial freedom from that initial 120,000 Is that accurate  
* Why if you do do you feel like the vehicle to allow you to multiply that 120,000 into long-term income is trading  
* Doesn't matter Why do you want to save this account specifically  
* So if I'm hearing you correctly to not have mentorship and to spend any more time or any more money trying to trade without the mentorship would basically be absurdity Is that accurate  
* So why do you feel like we're the people that you want that mentorship from so that you don't do something absurd and just keep trying to figure this out on your own and losing money  
* And you you're smart enough to realize you should probably do the same thing Is that accurate  
* Why would you like to do this  
* So my question for you Sam how many more days are you willing to not have the mentorship that you know you need that we've got for our clients that you've seen in all of our case studies knowing that to not have that mentorship right now guarantees that you'll continue to blow another account  
* How are you going to feel knowing that after 5 years your income has been stuck as a carpenter and it's going to stay stuck until you get mentorship right  
* Are you going to waste any more time  
* What's the main thing to think about for taking this next step for you  
* Do you need more time to think about it or are you ready to take the step  
* Do you want to think about it some more or are you ready to actually make the decision  
* Would you like to continue with a 100% chance that you're going to keep losing the money

* Why don't you focus on your business like why why why are we even talking about trading  
* how much money did your business give you personally last month  
* what percentage of that are you then deploying into investments currently  
* for how long have you been taking out more or less 50k and putting it into investments  
* when did you come to the realization that there might be a better way to invest some of this money and you would like to take action on that better way right now if you do come across it when did you have that realization  
* what led six months ago to you thinking at the very least I want to explore if there's a better way for me to deploy this capital  
* how much did you get back from your investments total portfolio 2 million in the last 30 days  
* so what what's the reason that you're interested in that  
* I'm curious Faith knowing that you've got $2 million in a portfolio that could be making you an extra $750,000 every 6 months how much longer do you want to continue to forfeit that money because you don't have the training that you need to master trading  
* what is it that is keep Why are you even considering this trading option  
* what is the reason you're making those investments  
* why have you been doing that  
* So Faith why are you investing i mean what's what's the objective what are you going to do with this money  
* what is the now thing that has you interested in doing that right now  
* what was it that motivated you to have this conversation now  
* given that that's with all due respect pocket change compared to the $200,000 you're paying yourself the $2 million you have in the portfolio with all respect Faith I'm still not clear why that means you're on this call right now  
* that's pocket change compared to the fact that you're making $200,000 a month and you have a $2 million portfolio  
* three months ago it sounds like something prompted you to no longer be satisfied with just staying at 10 to 15% returns what was that trigger point what was that moment  
* why trading  
* what were your friends doing  
* why do you want to do trading as well  
* given that they were doing real estate why do you want to do trading  
* what is it about that that makes you feel you want to do exactly the same thing as them to get essentially the same if not a better result  
* what was it about prop trading specifically from the research that you did as to why you chose it  
* understood what was it about the research you did of all the different options that made you conclude that prop firms were the best thing for you  
* Okay and so it doesn't sound like you're certain that that is your option how will you make that decision  
* I'm curious why is that why Prop Firm what what what is it about prop firm investing that got your attention  
* is it fair to say that your friends um that you saw were successful in doing this did they did they give you any indication of what that success looked like  
* would you pick the 50K or would you pick the 100K that you're comparing the 15 to 22 which one  
* what is maybe the the big picture for you as to why you want to move this money over to the the trading  
* what do you have any idea what you'd need that extra couple million on  
* what's the reason that you would really be wanting to have that couple of extra million when you sell your business  
* it sounds like the biggest thing for you is that you just wouldn't be willing to sacrifice an ounce of this hard work that you've grinded for without making sure you've capitalized to the absolute maximum on all of the money you've made and investing all the money you've made and multiplying all the money you've made is that accurate  
* what are you going to do about it

# Pain

Here is the transcript of questions suggested or spoken by Josh during the role play:

* In the last three months how much have you closed?  
* How much did you make on that rental?  
* Is that gross or after the split with your brokerage?  
* I know that was in the last three months how how much have you done total this year?  
* You said you're working part-time as a barista how many hours did you work last week as a barista?  
* And how much money did you make for those 15 hours?  
* Okay got it so you're you're working part-time in the last month how many hours did you work as a barista?  
* Okay so in those 80 hours I think you mentioned that you're making uh 15 per hour so that would be Okay let me see got it so you made about 1,200 last month?  
* And what do you typically take home what did you take home last month in tips?  
* Ricky okay so you made $1,400 last month what was left after your expenses?  
* Hm interesting doesn't sound like you've got much money at all at the end of the month so what I'm curious about is do you have any other money maybe savings something like that which is helping you to fund the business?  
* Okay so since you've got $300 a month left over doesn't sound like you have a lot do you have anything in savings and if so how much to potentially fund the business more?  
* So what I'm wondering is given that you're working the barista do job you're doing 80 hours a month on that and you only end up with 300 bucks a month at the end of the year i'm wondering how if you are are you funding your real estate business?  
* Okay got it okay so given that you're only left with $300 a month after your expenses I'm wondering how are you funding the business right now?  
* Okay and last month from selling the shoes how much were you able to make?  
* Okay so you've got you had 2,200 a month come in last month what I'm wondering though so I know your team is providing leads and everything but do you what do you have right now in savings though to be able to fund the business though outside of the team leads that they're giving you?  
* Well what exactly is the relationship between you two and what I'm politely asking is are you paying this guy?  
* Interesting so you're working for him for free quote unquote in in return for his uh training and mentorship?  
* What's his experience?  
* And then what I'm also wondering is given that you're not getting the results whether it's because he's not telling you the right things or you're not executing the right things how much longer do you have before that relationship comes to an end cuz you're not actually providing any value for him right?  
* How many leads did you get from your mentor in the last 30 days?  
* Got it okay so how many leads did you actually get from your mentor in the last 30 days that you're driving around right now?  
* And what is that split with your mentor?  
* Okay before wait before the broker split what do you mean?  
* How much has that typically been?  
* Okay so you're left with 4,000 after the mentor split so how much has that broker split typically been?  
* Okay so I want to go back i know they're giving you leads but I'm curious given that you said that you're getting about three at least it was last month why do you feel like you haven't been able to close any sales side transactions yet?  
* Contextualize it given that lead the given that these leads are coming from a guy that you call your mentor why do you feel you or he combined with your split together haven't been able to lock these leads down and close them?  
* Interesting how long have you felt that?  
* Why do you feel that way?  
* I'm curious how much longer are you going to work with the mentor with your mentor that you have right now if you feel like the leads are not what they need to be?  
* Given that these leads are coming from the guy that you're calling your your mentor why do you think between the two of you you haven't closed any?  
* Why do you think he's getting better results than you?  
* Interesting so you feel that the reason they're getting better leads is simply because they've been doing it longer is that accurate?  
* Okay how long have they been doing it?  
* Okay so if we if we round you up to a year and we say they've been doing it two to three times longer and you feel that that's why they're getting better results my question for you is do you want to wait another two three years before you get these same results?  
* Okay well if you feel the only way that they're getting better results is just the passage of time how do you plan on doing that?  
* You got me thinking yeah what are you thinking?  
* And that's what you think is all you need to do is just put more hours in put more hours in more training?  
* Okay so you got two options or both put more time in get further training or also put more time in and get further training where are you sitting in regards to which of those actions you want to take?  
* And so what was it about us that made you feel like the extra training that you're looking for you want to get that training from us specifically?  
* Okay well so if experience is the main thing then separating their results and yours what are you planning to do now then to replicate those results?  
* Okay so what I'm curious about too given that it's it's been 8 months what sorts of things have you tried to maybe I guess get more training maybe move your schedule around?  
* Okay so you're you're doing a lot of researching but have you done a lot of because I know you mentioned door knockocking being one thing have you done any door knockocking or cold calling to actually try and get more listings yet?  
* Okay so so so if you say you don't know how to what exactly are you getting out of all that research?  
* Well so when you brought up the choice between doing door knocking or cold calling to get listings to your mentor what was his advice on that?  
* Okay did he build his did he build his sphere of influence from being new?  
* So if that's what he did and that's what worked for him and he's your mentor why don't you just follow the same path as him and start from zero and build your sphere of influence?  
* Of the different options that we've discussed you've mentioned I don't want to wait a number of times why is that?  
* You want to move so quickly what is it going to take so you can move quickly?  
* Do you know people that have put in more hours and have still moved very slowly in life?  
* Why do you think that is?  
* Do you know what the right things are to do?  
* So even if you had more hours how are you going to be certain that those hours are not just going in the trash?  
* So what would it take for you to not only combine the extra hours with the certainty that you're doing the right things?  
* Okay interesting you said that you don't really like the idea of that because you'd be starting from zero i'm curious did your mentor start from zero with that same methodology?  
* Okay interesting so your mentor did he start from zero when he was building his sphere of influence?  
* Okay so I'm wondering right since you're working with him why not do the same thing?  
* Okay so because your mentor was doing the same thing and he started from zero I'm curious why don't you just build your sphere of influence starting from zero?  
* Interesting so you're saying that if you did do the same thing that he did build your sphere of influence from zero you would basically have to wait another 19 years and four months?  
* Okay so it sounds like one of the moves for you is just putting more time in what's kept you from just quitting your barista job and putting that extra time in?  
* Sure but if the way to make all the money from real estate is extra time why don't you just pay the bills with crushing it in real estate?  
* What do you mean by that?  
* Okay so if I heard you correctly Ricky you're saying that even if you put the extra time in you don't have the certainty that you'd be able to pay your bills by the time they come around from the real estate is that correct?  
* Why why do you feel that?  
* So it sounds like and correct me if if I'm wrong here but you've kind of got two options... sounds like those are kind of your two options unless you see things differently let me know?  
* Do you see any other options of how you can solve this challenge of being successful as a real estate?  
* Okay how then would you pay your bills?  
* Okay how many extra hours would you get back if you did that?  
* And what exactly would you do with those eight hours that you're not currently doing that you feel would if you feel it would get you the result that you need to then go full-time in the real estate?  
* Okay and do you feel that guy that you could get training from would want to give you 8 hours a week of his time?  
* Okay so you could kind of do a trade of I'll do some you know manual labor for you and you can give me some some training?  
* Okay so then you've got another two options... between those two options which are you leaning more towards?  
* Would you like to try working with him first and see if maybe between the two of you collaborating you could maybe get past two deals between the two of you would you like to put the time into that first cuz obviously you do want to move quickly but you're welcome to try that first if you want to?  
* Well that's what I'm asking you which do you think is going to get you the results quicker getting outside training coaching mentorship from a company like ours or testing things out with the guy with your extra eight hours?  
* Do you think that option is going to be the quickest option for you to get the result you want or outside training coaching mentorship?  
* Okay you've said probably now not criticizing you for saying probably but it doesn't sound like it's a definitive definitely this versus that why is that?  
* It's about like for like if you put eight hours in with your current option that you just shared with me or you put the same eight hours in working with us for outside training mentorship coaching which one of those do you prefer based on the fact it's going to get you the result you want in the speed of time that you want?  
* Which of those two do you think is going to get you the best result leveraging outside help and how certain on that are you on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being absolutely that's the decision I need to make zero being could potentially try working with the other coach first where are you on a scale of 1 to 10?  
* Eight or nine i still sense a little bit of hesitation from you what do you eight or nine?  
* So putting the exact same amount of hours in to option A working with the guy at your company to option B working with a company like ours are you saying that you're only an eight out of 10 sure that this option would be better than this option you're only you're only eight out of 10 is that what you're saying for the same amount of hours?  
* Okay well and and between those two options I think more importantly because you're fortunate enough to have a a mentor when you talked with him about how you should go get listings what was his advice?  
* Okay why do you think that is that he's just only working with warm leads did he have to do any of that cold calling in the past to get to that point?  
* Okay and given that again you've got a mentor who's already done that why do you feel like you can't replicate the same thing to get business for yourself?  
* I'm curious given that those are the two options that you see yourself having why haven't you tested both of them to figure out which is the right one to go all in on?  
* Okay so if I'm understanding this correctly Ricky you've got a mentor that is telling you I accomplished the results that you want doing a method that you don't want to do... my question for you is number one is that all accurate?  
* Number two how much longer do you want to be stuck at the start line because you do not have the people around you for training support mentorship or community that would actually allow you to be successful in real estate and make the money that you truly want to be making?  
* How much longer do you want to stay in that position of essentially scarcity of guidance?  
* So 8 months ago you you said that you realize you're just too financially broke what What made you realize that?  
* Did your girlfriend see your phone?  
* So you're in a relationship with this girl she obviously wants to go out for dinner you did it because you're obviously a nice person that wants to give her what she wants but you're now having to choose between having your relationship continue or literally being with a dollar in your account is that accurate?  
* My question for you is how does that feel for you how do you feel right now to be trapped between those two desires?  
* When did you come to that conclusion?  
* So you don't want to work with the buyers you've been doing this for eight months when did you realize that?  
* So Ricky given that you've been doing this for eight months working with buyers when did you realize that you don't want to work with buyers anymore?  
* Interesting so when Sorry Rick I didn't quite catch it you say that was October?  
* And you were driving around what exactly were you driving around doing?  
* What day was it?  
* What time did you start driving them around?  
* And what time did you finish both days?  
* Wow so 10 till 4 both Saturday and Sunday driving this guy around and he didn't buy anything correct?  
* What do you usually do on a weekend?  
* Okay so if if if this is what you normally do on a weekend is drive people around do work why did it bother you so much?  
* It sounds like this isn't the first time this happened correct?  
* Okay so help me understand given it had happened so many times before why was this one time so so much of a turning point for you?  
* Was there anything specific that you can remember about driving around the houses the guy maybe that was like I'm done with this was there any any specifics?  
* When you had been so elevated emotionally thinking this guy's this guy's a good fit this guy's you know a hot buyer and then it didn't happen how did you feel?  
* Okay can you elaborate a little bit more?  
* I mean I get you i hear what you're saying wasting your time but was there any other thoughts that went through your head?

# Biz Opp

* is that accurate  
* So what's the situation  
* does this make sense is that accurate Zach how you why you kind of responded with a much shorter response  
* interesting you said you're in this exploratory phase when did that begin  
* what was going on 6 months ago  
* what do you mean that happened  
* And when did you start to feel this way  
* Did something you know happen recently for you where you decided now it's time for me to take action and start booking some calls  
* have you come to a conclusion on how much longer you are willing to hang out at the cafe  
* What What's causing the 30-day delay  
* and so are you saying you don't have any time right now that you could start lining things up so that you've given in your notice whilst building up what you need or are you saying you want to just do nothing to execute on this and then hand in your notice and then start the process a new  
* What would you prefer to do in terms of timelining both of these things  
* what about your timeline to get started on building the replacement for your job  
* how did you perceive what I was doing there  
* what's going on for you financially right now that means you've come to this conclusion it's time to do something different  
* how much did you make last month  
* not enough for what  
* why is this  
* you mentioned a couple of different things can I just ask you directly is your girlfriend the reason that this is a problem that you want to solve  
* how much of you wanting to sort your finances out right now is because you want to provide those experiences for her  
* is that the reason right now that you're on this call to solve your finances  
* what is it  
* when was the last time that happened  
* Your girlfriend wants to go out for dinner and you tell her you can't go for blank blank blank cuz you don't have money you tell her you can't go  
* Your girlfriend wants to go and you don't take her  
* interesting so you mentioned you're shielding your girlfriend from your lack of finances so my question for you is sounds like in reference to shielding her you're playing defense when are you going to start playing offense  
* what are the things that you're shielding her from  
* what would admitting to her that you can't do in regards to why you want to shield her from that  
* why don't you just admit to her that you're a loser if that's what you're telling me you are and you're basically just hiding it  
* and so you think the best thing to do is lie to her instead  
* does she know you're putting it on a credit card  
* is it that she doesn't understand or is it that you haven't been fully honest with her  
* do you think you're going to be able to overcome that pinch without facing the truth  
* how are you going to have confidence in a road map that you've never walked down  
* do you think the confidence comes from within you or do you think the confidence ultimately comes from some external plan  
* how much of that internal faith and drive and commitment do you feel you have right now today to actually action something within myself  
* how are you going to get over that  
* how would you feel if I said it's 50/50 50% you 50% us guiding you giving you the plan do you think you can step up to halfway if we meet you halfway  
* can you commit to that  
* why  
* when was the last time you were asked by your girlfriend to go out for dinner whatever and you told her no  
* what happened  
* is there any part of you that feels like maybe she does know and she's kind of being nice on you because she loves you  
* what were you thinking the last time it happened  
* do you think that thought anything behind what she was saying or she genuinely was just okay with it and enjoying dinner  
* clarify this for me why do you think that she might have a limit on how many times she's willing to go through this lowering of her standards before she thinks maybe I'm above this guy's league  
* what would she actually say from the heart  
* correct how do you feel about the situation of choosing to take your girl away from the higher level experiences that she's used to whether she wants them or not  
* why is that

# Sales Coaching

* What exactly is saturated?  
* Was there anything additional to just passing over 12 months that meant he reflected?  
* What does he mean by reflecting?  
* Does that mean he was looking at his bank account?  
* Does that mean he was looking at his newborn baby in the eyes and thinking "Shit I can't afford to take care of this newborn"?  
* What does reflecting mean?  
* So what I'm wondering Brian is you've been doing this for a whole year correct me if I'm wrong but are these competitors new competitors?  
* Was there something that led you to reflect on it now?  
* So when you say a little bit off pace if I've got the maths right you're at 40 you wanted to triple so that would have been 120 you're at 70 so you're down by $50,000 a year is that accurate?  
* Given that you're at 40 before and you're down by 50 for what you need you're down by more than your previous entire income but you say you're a little bit off i'm I'm not quite connecting the dots there?  
* So if I'm hearing you correctly one of the reasons that you view it as just a little bit down is because you think there's only a few things that need to change to immediately bridge that gap is that is that accurate?  
* I'm wondering is this just a little problem for you and perhaps that's why it hasn't been solved or what's really going on?  
* How much longer do you want to keep denying it and being $50,000 behind how much you need to take care of your wife and your kids?  
* If I said yes are you ready to go right now?  
* What was your expectation?  
* Why was that expectation something that you moved forward on?  
* Why was that expectation such an aim for you?  
* So you mentioned you think it could be the market in your opinion what do you feel is the reason that you're down by $50,000 on last year?  
* So what I'm wondering is do you feel the economy accounts for your income dropping by 25%?  
* What percentage of that if 25% was the economy's accounted for all of it where would you put that percentage would you say it's 20% of it 10% give me a number?  
* Who's the top right now in terms of what their numbers are?  
* Do you know where they were last year?  
* So my question then is why in the same environment in the same economy have you gone down by 25% down by $50,000 and they've gone up by $70,000 in other words the difference between the two of you is $120,000 why?  
* When you say you could grind it out grind what out Brian?  
* Just out of curiosity Brian if you did go that way and you grinded it out how long do you think if you'd ever get there do you think it would take for you to have that experience so that you would then be getting the results like the other guy how long do you think that would take?  
* Is there any part of you that would be willing to lose that $300,000 for lack of experience over the next three years?  
* What do you have to do now to get the experience in a much more condensed period of time?  
* What exactly is going on right now with you being so far behind in terms of the situation with your wife the situation at home what's going on right now?  
* How much longer do you want your lack of experience your lack of skill set your lack of expertise to have such a negative impact on every area of your life from your wife to your newborn to your mental health to your physical health to your social life how much longer are you willing to pay that price?  
* What was it about my training that made you feel like I'm the person you want to pay to get that experience?

# E-com

* Is there anything that’s not manageable enough for you right now?  
* Is there something that isn’t manageable for you right now?  
* In what way has it been difficult the last three years?  
* Is there any other big reasons that you want to get into ecom now or big challenges that you're having which is pushing you in that direction right now?  
* Have you made $6,000 every month per month for the last 12 months, Jay?  
* What were your expenses last month?  
* What are your expenses right now?  
* What did you mean by that?  
* What were your monthly expenses last month?  
* How much total have you put aside towards those next steps?  
* Have you got an idea in your head right now of how much money you do need to actually be able to take those next steps?  
* When you said that you want to have a house and you want to have a family, how old are you right now?  
* How do you feel about that 42 years old?  
* Why can’t you do it at 42?  
* Have you got a number in your mind of what would be when you do want to accomplish this by?  
* What is some type of gap that you're thinking right now?  
* What is the thing that's missing for you?  
* What would the marker be in your mind of that is enough money to have however many more kids you want to have the house?  
* What would make you feel that switch of this is enough?  
* Are you saying you would save a 100red invest into the house and have 40,000 left or are you saying you want 60,000 then you would invest the 60k and you'd still have 100?  
* Which one, having 40,000 left or or having $100,000 left?  
* How many more children do you want ideally?  
* If you were still making $6,000 a month but you had 40 grand savings and you had a house, would that be okay for you?  
* Is that enough?  
* Do you have a number in your head of like what your amount of monthly net income would make you feel comfortable to be paying the expenses of a much larger house, looking after your wife, looking after yourself and looking after your four kids?  
* So you need 20,000 a month income and you need a 100,000 lump sum, is that right?  
* What would you ballpark?  
* If you had a $20,000 a month income right now and you had this beautiful big house and you had 40,000 in the bank, then would you want to spread this out over 5 years or is the timeline coming because you feel like it's reasonable?  
* In an ideal world, if you had all the money, would you literally want to do this like every nine months, like you're just popping out another baby every nine months if you had the money?  
* Does she want even more than three more?  
* Does that make sense?  
* When you hear the number $28,000 a month from ecom, how do you feel about that number?  
* What does she do online?  
* Do you know what she makes a month?  
* How much do you believe on a scale of 1 to 10 that if you moved into ecom you had the right training, you had the right support and guidance that that would actually be a possibility for you?  
* Where would you put yourself on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being absolutely I can do this with the right support?  
* Jay, I'm curious what's going on for you right now that has you wanting to make a change?  
* What I'm not clear on is your thought process as far as the solution to her not being hype about your financial situation is to have more children and get a bigger house?  
* Have you come to a resolution between those two things?  
* What do you think that means, Jay?  
* When did you want this?  
* Is that accurate?  
* Is that what you're saying?  
* What was the kind of reason that after you had your first child you both decided to sit down and have a conversation about the vision?  
* Was there either one of you in that conversation that led the conversation meaning like you opened up the conversation shared what you wanted and she said "Me too," or the other way round or or anything like that?  
* Was there any part of you that said it was what you wanted because you wanted to tell her the same thing or was it 100% what you want for you as well?  
* Does that make sense?  
* Do you think your wife's thought this deeply into it, the imbalance between her contribution to the life that you promised her and your contribution to the life that you promised her?  
* Do you think she's been thinking about this?  
* Can I be direct with you?  
* Are you going to get off this call and look your wife in the eyes knowing that you are now fully conscious and aware of that stupidity having not taken an action to fix it for her, or are you going to take the leap, take the action and do the thing that you need to do so that when you get off this call you can look her in the eyes knowing that you're no longer playing stupid?  
* Are you going to apologize to her with words and tell her I'm sorry and still go to her next month with a $6,000 paycheck or are you going to actually give her a sincere apology which is actually taking an action to fix the problem?
