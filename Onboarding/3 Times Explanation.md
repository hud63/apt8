## Three Time Categories

### 1. Billable Time

- Any time spent on client work
- Includes time even if it gets written off (e.g., fixing mistakes from underscoping)
- Target: **75% of your time**
- Logged to: **Client project task in ClickUp**
- Counts toward your utilization calculation

### 2. Business Time

- Valuable work for the company that isn’t client-facing
- Examples: helping sales with context on a past client, certifications for client technology, security certifications
- **Requires manager approval** → tag manager in ClickUp, then they escalate to DoD
- Effect: **Subtracts from your available hours denominator** (so it still benefits your utilization)
- Logged to: **A8 Internal list in ClickUp**

### 3. Non-Billable Time

- Everything else: standups, 1:1s, organizing your day, internal meetings, onboarding
- Target: ~**25% of your time**
- Logged to: **A8 Internal list in ClickUp**

**Utilization Formula:**

```
Utilization = Billable Hours ÷ (Available Hours - PTO - Business Time)
```
