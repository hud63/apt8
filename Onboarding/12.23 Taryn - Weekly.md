# 12.23 Mark <> Taryn - Weekly

Tue, 23 Dec 25

### Holiday Plans and Family Time

- Taryn heading to Deep Creek Lake December 26-29/30 with extended family
    
    - Large log cabin rental through her mom’s best friend - described as huge wood cabin with fireplace, all wood interior creating “winter in the woods” feeling
        
    - Wine tasting schedule planned with family members rotating twin care duties (“here, take this one”)
        
    - Rare opportunity for all siblings and partners in one house for extended time - normally only see each other for dinners/brunches in Columbia
        
    - Tomorrow (Dec 24) will be challenging: Pat working all day while Taryn cleans house, organizes gifts, and preps for hosting dinner and breakfast
        
    - Won’t see two other sisters who normally join December 26th celebrations
        
    - Family enjoys card games, scary movies (which Pat doesn’t like), and collaborative cooking schedule
        
    - Acknowledges there will “probably be one fight” during extended family time
        
- Taryn’s home setup: two Christmas trees solution
    
    - Plastic tree in foyer - tall and skinny, initially thought would solve everything but “looks like Ozempic tree”
        
    - Real tree in living room - shorter and fatter to fit the space with windows
        
    - House described as open concept from front to back with high ceilings, former show house
        
- Mark staying local for Christmas as single person
    
    - Plans for Christmas Eve outings, otherwise normal weekend activities with friends
        
    - No Christmas tree - believes “females have to be living with you to get a Christmas tree” and “need a woman to suggest the tree”
        
    - Mom will be making cookies
        
- Taryn’s location: Trapp area outside Easton, Maryland (4 years there)
    
    - 15 minutes off highway to reach house, “middle of nowhere” but nice house and land
        
    - Previous owners didn’t want to sell but had to due to illness
        

### HubSpot Quote Configuration Strategy

- Current tool allocation by client:
    
    - Native HubSpot quotes: JLG and Whistle Express
        
    - Quote Happily: recommended for GreenX
        
    - TalGlass: dealing with Tacton integration issues
        
- Third-party tools required when complexity exceeds basic quote→invoice→payment workflow
    
    - Level of customizations needed determines tool choice
        
    - Key complexity factors:
        
        1. Quote approval processes
            
        2. Invoice generation and signing
            
        3. Payment processing integration
            
        4. Inventory management requirements
            
        5. Regulatory compliance needs
            
- Advanced complexity triggers requiring external tools:
    
    - Multiple product vs service line items with different logic
        
    - Geographic restrictions determining available SKUs
        
    - Role-based discount limitations (certain levels only for specific items)
        
    - Multi-step verification processes before inventory allocation
        
    - Custom build requirements with verification steps
        
- TalGlass example illustrates complexity: needs custom building in certain ways, verification processes, then inventory checks with availability confirmation
    
- Sales team challenges with scoping due to software variety and complexity
    

### Project Scoping and Team Structure

- Lead sources and revenue drivers:
    
    - Majority of leads come through HubSpot referrals (primary revenue driver)
        
    - Clients switching from expensive Dynamics/Salesforce due to cost
        
    - Companies moving from inadequate CRM solutions (NetSuite as CRM, ServiceTitan, MailChimp combinations)
        
- Scoping accuracy challenges:
    
    - Repetitive integration types help with experience building (NetSuite, Suite Commerce, Jira)
        
    - NetSuite integration reality: no true “native” integration exists, all require customization
        
    - Historical data shows NetSuite integrations range 21-56 hours
        
    - Sales team setting poor expectations by mentioning “native NetSuite integration”
        
- Three distinct service team structures:
    
    1. Enterprise team: large multi-hub implementations (Sales Hub + Service Hub + Marketing Hub + multiple integrations)
        
    2. Core team: single hub implementations or lighter projects
        
    3. Retainer team: existing customers needing ongoing support
        
    
    - All teams are completely separate with dedicated resources
        
- Technical review and escalation process:
    
    - Michelle handles technical aspects for complex integrations (like 360 implementations)
        
    - Strategy and enterprise teams can pull in implementation specialists (VAS, J Lo) for scoping workshops
        
    - Process: review requirements, determine build approach, estimate hours, right-size scope
        
    - Project Champions (PC) and Delivery Leads (DL) review scopes before client presentation when time permits
        
- Hour tracking and scope management:
    
    - Teams track actual vs estimated hours for learning and adjustment
        
    - Overages communicated as “hey, this will exceed hours because of X, Y, Z”
        
    - Example workflow scoping: initially 5-8 hours, actually requires 8-10 hours
        
- Mark’s user story creation process:
    
    - Taryn will review user stories Mark creates
        
    - Recommendation: always come with proposed solution, then collaborate on refinement
        
    - Will determine if workshops with technical team members (VAS) are needed
        

### Open Questions / Follow-ups

- GreenX phone leads without emails: need to present options analysis for handling this data limitation
    
- Technical reviewer involvement timing: clarify at what project stage Michelle or implementation team should be consulted
    
- Scope review process: when time doesn’t permit PC/DL review before client presentation, what’s the backup process?
    
- NetSuite integration messaging: how to better communicate customization reality to sales team and clients

### 2. CPQ Strategy: Native vs. Third-Party

I notice we’re recommending **Quote.Hapily** for Greenix but looking at **HubSpot Native Quotes** for JLG and Whistle Express. What specific limitations in HubSpot’s native CPQ typically trigger your recommendation to move to a third-party tool like Hapily? Is it usually about the complexity of the math or the flexibility of the document output?

### 3. Identity Resolution: Fallbacks for Phone Leads

"The Greenix prep highlights the risk of **'orphaned contacts'** from phone leads without emails. Since this is a recurring issue across VAFB and Whistle as well, do you usually recommend a custom 'Identity Resolution' workflow that matches by **Phone + Last Name** as a fallback, or do you find it's more effective to make Email a 'Hard Gate' for the sales team to move to the next stage?"

### 4. Data Governance Scaling

"VAFB has a massive **Data Classification Inventory** because of their HIPAA/PII requirements. For Greenix, where we’re syncing FieldRoutes data that contains service history and address details, how much of that Enterprise-level governance do we apply? Do we keep it lean for them, or do we use the same 'Controlled Data' framework to protect their customer database?"

### 4. **VAFB & JLG: Contact vs. Company-centric data models**

VAFB needs unified customer profiles across insurance and membership. JLG has the district/school/contact hierarchy. Greenix is shifting commercial to company-centric. How do you decide the right object structure early in strategy?

### 5. **All Accounts: How do you prioritize what goes in Phase 1 vs. Phase 2?**

I see phasing in Taoglas, Abundance 360, and potentially these other accounts. What criteria do you use to split projects - is it timeline-driven, technical complexity, or something else?

### 3. **Michelle T's role: When does Solution Engineering get pulled in?**

JLG has the SAP B1 custom integration and hosting partner complexity. VAFB has the Finys/Personify integration architecture. At what point in the sales or strategy process do you typically loop Michelle T in to pressure-test technical feasibility?
