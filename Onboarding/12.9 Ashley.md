### Ashley’s Client Documentation System

- All active client docs stored in A8 Google Drive with dedicated client folders
    
- Each client has own folder structure with strategy subfolder for engagements
    
- Ashley creates strategy subfolder and puts all created documents inside
    
- Central hub workflow still under development - not fully consolidated yet
    
- Challenge: some docs from Terence haven’t been shared to client folders
    
    - May need to chase down missing documentation
        
    - Working toward having everything in centralized location
        
- Template access through Google Drive for scope development and deliverables
    

### Trumpet Integration for Client Deliverables

- Recently adopted app originally built as sales showroom, co-opted for client document management
    
- Sales team started using first, strategy team got licenses after discovering utility
    
- Replaces problematic long lists of Google Doc links with single consolidated access point
    
- Backend widget system with multiple embed options and integrations
    
- Client experience: one link to access all deliverables vs managing multiple document links
    
- Example implementations:
    
    - Live Google Sheet embedding with real-time updates
        
    - Custom pricing calculator built by Michelle (embedded development)
        
    - Lucidchart diagram integration for visual documentation
        
    - Formatted document displays pulling from various sources
        
- Not every client gets Trumpet room - depends on complexity and deliverable volume
    
- Clients see polished, formatted versions of all documentation in organized interface
    

### Scope Development Template Workflow

- Master template stored in Google Drive with built-in scripting for automation
    
- Template includes HubSpot integration scripts and configuration options
    
- Standard process flow:
    
    1. Copy master template to specific client folder
        
    2. Configure client details on configuration page
        
    3. Populate work streams, service titles, suggested paths, assumptions
        
    4. System automatically creates HubSpot deals based on status changes
        
    5. Integration pulls data into Trumpet for client-facing display
        
    6. ClickUp tasks created (timing uncertain - may be automatic or manual trigger)
        
- Connected systems: HubSpot, Trumpet, ClickUp, Salesforce integration
    
- Hour estimation methodology:
    
    - Generate low-end and high-end hour estimates for each work stream
        
    - Contract at middle point between low/high for competitive closing rates
        
    - Show high-end estimates to clients as expectation management
        
    - Prepares clients for potential change orders if complexity increases
        
- Assumptions function as scope guardrails to prevent scope creep
    
- Example projects referenced: Speed to Lead, Tau Glass implementations
    

### Discovery Interview Process Management

- Interview agendas created using Claude AI as starting point, then refined
    
- Pre-interview preparation:
    
    - Upload presale call transcripts to AI project for context
        
    - Generate initial questions based on engagement goals and known background
        
    - Refine AI suggestions with specific client knowledge and previous discoveries
        
- Status tracking system with visual indicators:
    
    - Clock emoji: scheduled but not yet completed
        
    - Yellow highlight: completed interview, awaiting summary generation
        
    - Green check mark: summarized and ready for client sharing
        
- Post-interview workflow:
    
    1. Take detailed notes during live call
        
    2. Pull transcript from [Otter.ai](http://otter.ai/) platform
        
    3. Run transcript through Claude or ChatGPT for summary generation
        
    4. Review AI-generated summary for accuracy and completeness
        
    5. Replace original questions with polished summary content
        
    6. Update status to green check when ready for client delivery
        
- AI project management approach:
    
    - Create dedicated projects in Claude/ChatGPT for each client
        
    - Upload client-provided documents, call transcripts, generated deliverables
        
    - Maintains project-specific “brain” with all relevant context
        
    - Careful curation to prevent AI from operating on incorrect assumptions
        
- Document evolution: questions → notes → summary → client deliverable
    
- Challenge: process loses original questions in favor of summary format
    
- Version history available but clunky for reference purposes
    

### Current Client Example (Abundance 360 - Teddy Exception)

- Teddy represents unusual case due to high technical sophistication
    
- Able to complete interview questions asynchronously with detailed responses
    
- Typical clients require live interviews for proper context and follow-up clarification
    
- Standard clients either don’t take async questions seriously or need additional context
    
- Teddy’s detailed comments will be converted into clean summary format
    
- Plan to incorporate his responses into standard doc structure for client delivery
    
- Demonstrates flexibility in process while maintaining end deliverable quality
    
- Next step: clean up Teddy’s comments into polished summary today

### ![⭐](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/2b50/32.png) Key Takeaways

- A central client document repository is maintained on the Aptitude 8 Google Drive, with each client folder containing a dedicated strategy subfolder, though some documents still require follow-up with Terrence.
- Trumpet is being utilized as a consolidated sales showroom, embedding interactive widgets like Michelle's pricing calculator to organize and present deliverable links to clients.
- A workflow using Google Sheets templates is in place for scoping engagements, where embedded scripts update HubSpot deals and trigger formatted displays in Trumpet.
- Integration between ClickUp and Google Sheets links workstreams with client scoping, synchronizing project data from sales to implementation phases.
- Interview workflows involve capturing call transcripts, using AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude for generating summaries, and refining the notes into polished deliverables before client sharing, with Slack notifications for updates.
