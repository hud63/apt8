- Oversees all three practice areas (Enterprise, Core, Recurring)
    
- Pricing structure: $245/hour projects, $220/hour retainers, strategy even higher
    
    - Among most expensive partners in industry due to high-quality deliverables
        
    - HubSpot’s go-to for highly technical, highly custom implementations
        
- Company philosophy: Deliver projects without bleeding out, make customers “raving fans”
    
- Recent client review: “Working with this team was one of the greatest privileges of my career”
    

### Practice Areas & Team Structure

- **Recurring Practice (Amber - Director of Delivery)**
    
    - Long-term monthly retainer engagements (3, 6, or 12 month contracts)
        
    - Extremely proactive approach: go into systems, analyze reports, identify optimization opportunities
        
    - Don’t wait for client requests - recommend training, adoption, system improvements
        
    - 2 current teams: Marin (4 people), Purple (5 people)
        
    - Structure: delivery lead + 4-6 consultants
        
    - Consultant pairs assigned per retainer (lead + support roles rotate)
        
    - Large retainers (60+ hours/month) get third person
        
    - Hours are use-or-lose monthly, reset first of each month, billed monthly
        
    - Typically receives projects after Core/Enterprise completion for ongoing maintenance
        
- **Core Practice (Mark - New Director of Delivery)**
    
    - Project-based, typically ≤500 hours, 3-6 month timeline
        
    - Example: Bidirectional Salesforce integration + Marketing Hub setup from Mailchimp
        
    - Small pod structure: delivery lead + 2-3 consultants per team
        
    - 4 current teams (mix of color names and NATO alphabet - legacy naming)
        
    - Some teams expanding to 3 consultants soon
        
    - Strategic PM assignment: not every project gets PM (waste of hours on 150-hour projects)
        
    - 566-hour project example: will get PM despite being Core due to complexity
        
    - Delivery leads can manage smaller projects independently
        
- **Enterprise Practice (Taryn - Senior Director of Strategy, Soraki - Director of Delivery)**
    
    - Project-based, 500+ hours (up to 1600-2000 hours seen)
        
    - 6-24 month timeline, highly complex multi-system integrations
        
    - Example: 7 systems integration, custom builds, 14 teams across 3 continents, 7 stakeholders
        
    - Every project requires dedicated project manager
        
    - Principal consultants (PCs): project owners, drive strategy, not people managers
        
    - Bench model: 9 consultants pulled based on expertise/strengths for specific work streams
        
    - Current staff: 2 PMs (Noel, Elias), 1 account manager (Sam), 3 principal consultants
        
    - Much more high-touch, clients need more handholding
        

### Strategy Department & Project Flow

- Strategy as pre-project phase for uncertain clients
    
- Use cases: Feasibility evaluations, migration roadmaps, optimization assessments
    
    - CRM evaluation: “Is HubSpot right for us vs current system?”
        
    - Complex migrations: Blueprint creation for delivery teams
        
    - Hot mess assessment: “Everything’s broken, help us figure out what needs fixing”
        
- Sometimes HubSpot isn’t the answer - team will recommend alternatives
    
- Creates detailed customer stories and solutions design
    
- Light discovery needed when transferring to delivery (mostly knowledge transfer)
    
- Not all Enterprise deals go through Strategy - depends on client clarity
    
- Mark will be heavily involved in Strategy work
    
- Collaboration with Michelle T (Solution Engineer) for technical solutioning
    

### Project Methodology & Kickoff Process

- **Internal Kickoff (IKO)**: Sales team knowledge transfer to delivery team
    
    - Review customer stories, clarify assumptions, discuss client communication style
        
    - Strategy team does separate IKO to delivery after strategy completion
        
- **External Kickoffs**: Two-phase approach
    
    - **Mobilization**: Sales + Director of Delivery only (pre-team involvement)
        
        - Addresses 4-week project lead time issue
            
        - Covers: working procedures, shared inbox, ClickUp access, project phases, RACI charts
            
    - **Activation**: Actual team kickoff with delivery lead/principal consultant
        
        - Scope confirmation, success definition, KPI alignment, timeline review
            
        - Schedule requirements analysis discovery sessions
            
- **Project Phases**: Requirements analysis → Solutions design → Implementation → Testing/Training → Launch
    
- **Scope Validation**: Mandatory checkpoint after solutions design
    
    - Team reviews all stories against actual complexity discovered
        
    - Change orders processed before implementation begins
        
    - Hours reallocation (no refunds): unused hours redirected to additional scope or flex bucket
        

### Communication Standards & Client Management

- **BRAINS Framework** (mandatory for all weekly sprint meetings):
    
    - **Budget**: Contextualized pacing (“100 hours left, on track” vs “pacing hot, here’s why”)
        
    - **Review**: Work awaiting client approval/feedback
        
    - **Active**: Current work in progress this week
        
    - **Issues/Blockers**: What’s stuck, what client needs to provide, impact timelines
        
    - **Next**: Following week’s planned work
        
    - **Schedule**: Timeline status, any end date changes, holiday impacts
        
- **Meeting Structure**: Pilot/copilot approach, two people minimum per call
    
    - Pilot drives conversation/strategy, copilot takes notes/sends recap
        
    - Roles rotate based on call topic and expertise
        
- **Communication Tools**:
    
    - Front shared inbox: [client-name@a8services.com](mailto:client-name@a8services.com), forwards to entire team
        
    - Shared drafts capability, prevents duplicate responses
        
    - No Slack with clients (rare exceptions for 5+ year clients)
        
    - Avoma for automatic call recording with AI features
        
- **Boundaries**: No same-day requests except emergencies, no booking links in email signatures
    

### Daily Operations & Work Standards

- **Time Tracking**: Daily logging mandatory
    
    - Client has real-time ClickUp access to see hours logged
        
    - Weekly sprint budget discussions must reflect current data
        
    - Late logging causes client communication issues (“100 hours left” becomes “60 hours left”)
        
- **Working Hours**: 9-6 Eastern Monday-Friday
    
    - Flexibility allowed with manager approval and calendar blocking
        
    - Example: Michelle leaves 5pm daily for daycare pickup, makes up hour elsewhere
        
    - No expectation to respond outside business hours
        
    - Rare after-hours work for launches (planned well in advance)
        
- **Utilization Target**: 75% client work, 25% internal work
    
- **Weekly Planning**: Modified agile, weekly sprint structure
    
    - Tasks planned week-by-week, individual daily scheduling flexibility
        
    - Weekly deadlines vs specific daily assignments
        
- **Meeting Requirements**:
    
    - 24-hour agenda delivery, 24-hour recap email
        
    - Camera on, professional waist-up appearance
        
    - ClickUp documents for meeting notes and agendas
        
    - Front templates for agenda/recap emails
        
- **Team Operations**: Daily standups, weekly Salesforce/ClickUp health updates, project phase tracking
    

### Technology Department & Cross-Team Collaboration

- **Technology Team (Reed - VP of Technology)**: 5 developers + Michelle T (Solution Engineer)
    
- **Michelle T Role**: Steps in for highly technical solution engineering
    
    - Custom integration hosting decisions (DigitalOcean vs AWS)
        
    - Server specifications, RAM requirements, native vs custom code decisions
        
    - Provides developers detailed technical specifications
        
    - Close collaboration with Mark on Strategy engagements
        
- **Other Departments**:
    
    - **Marketing**: M (Emily Wingrove - CMO), coordinator, demand gen manager, marketing manager
        
    - **Sales**: Noah (Co-CEO), Megan Brooks (Sales Director), 3 Solution Architects + 3 Account Executives
        
    - **People Operations**: Megs (VP), Rebecca (Head of Systems/Finance Ops), Martin (Senior Systems Engineer)
        
- **Upcoming Changes**: Switching from ClickUp to Rocket Lane PSA system
    
    - Martin leading implementation and Salesforce integration
        
    - Described as “ClickUp on crack”
