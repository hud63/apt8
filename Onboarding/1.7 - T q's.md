  1. What are the must-have artifacts or decisions you want before implementation kicks off to keep the handoff clean and avoid rework?


• Here are five higher‑level Greenix‑aligned questions, informed by the three E folders:
               
  - In your opinion what is the cleanest “definition of done” for Greenix Phase 1 so we avoid scope drift?                                                                                         
  - What do we need to lock down before build starts so we don’t discover major gaps mid‑project?                                                                                                  
                                                           

• 1. In your opinion what is the minimum “single customer view” we can credibly promise VAFB in a quick‑moving strategy without over‑scoping Finys/Personify identity resolution?

     Why: VAFB prep highlights Finys vs Personify silos and identity resolution as the technical linchpin for “Single Customer View.”                                                                              
                                              
  2. For VAFB’s system‑agnostic stance, what must we show in the strategy output so they don’t perceive “HubSpot bias”?                                         
                                        
     Why: VAFB prep explicitly stresses a system‑agnostic approach and the need to present architecture as a fit, not a platform default.                              
                                 
                            
                                           
  2. VAFB has 10–12 stakeholder groups while Whistle Express is board/ELT‑driven; what’s your preferred executive storyline for each so we keep momentum without adding meetings?                  
     Why: VAFB prep lists many teams/stakeholders; Whistle Express prep emphasizes ELT/Board leadership focus.  


  3. For VAFB field agents, what is the one quick win you want them to feel in the first 90 days?
     
     Why: The VAFB prep calls out adoption risk with field agents and emphasizes 90-day sales quick wins.
     
  3. For VAFB timing, how do you want us to align change messaging with the intranet launch so it does not get lost?
     
     Why: The VAFB prep lists the intranet launch as a key readiness dependency for change management.

  3. For Whistle Express, what is the first marketing action Spencer should be able to take that proves consolidation is working?      
                                                                 
     Why: The prep doc names Spencer as marketing leader and links SSOT to faster, coordinated communications across regions.
