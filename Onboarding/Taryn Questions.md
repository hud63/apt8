*   **Transcript to Artifacts:** How do you typically bridge the gap between the raw discovery transcripts (like Discovery Part 1 & 2) and the structured "User Stories" linked in the strategy doc? 
  Do you have a specific workflow or set of prompts you use to extract those requirements?

1. **Your Discovery Philosophy**
   - In Discovery Part 1, you said: "You can throw a technology onto any process, and if it's a ****** process, it doesn't matter what technology." 
     How do you typically identify when a client has process problems vs. technology problems?
     
   - What are the key signs you look for during discovery that tell you the real issue is process, not tools?
     
1. **Interview Technique**
   - I noticed you start broad ("What marketing efforts are you doing?") then drill into specifics. Is this your standard discovery flow?
     
   - How do you decide when to dive deeper vs. when to move on to the next topic?
     
   -   - How do you structure user stories - is there a template you use (Avoma) ?
     
   - Do you always present multiple paths, or was the "Path A vs Path B" for BI tools specific to this situation?
     
     8. **Interview Summaries**
   - The summary doc has a single massive paragraph with all the key points. Is this auto-generated from Avoma, or did you write it?
   - How do you use these summaries - just for your own reference, or do clients see them?

- 5. **The HubSpot Situation**
   - The doc mentions they invested $70K+ in HubSpot that couldn't be used. How did you navigate that conversation?
   - When a client has already invested heavily in a failed solution, how do you handle the recommendation to move to something else?
---

1. **External Links in Deliverables**
   - The strategy doc has links to Google Sheets (user stories), Lucidchart (process maps), Google Docs (BI recommendations), and Avoma (recordings)
   - Is this your standard structure? Do clients get copies of all these, or just links?
