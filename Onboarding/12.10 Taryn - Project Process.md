### Taoglas Project Status & Process

- Optimization SKU project strategically split into two distinct phases:
    - Phase 1: Speed-to-lead implementation ready for signature
        - SOW presented by Ashley, awaiting board approval and signature
        - Will kick off with Amanda (DL on core team) upon signature
        - Focuses on lead scoring implementation using latest HubSpot capabilities
    - Phase 2: Heavy integration and data modeling work
        - Ashley still conducting workshops (Thursday/Friday sessions scheduled)
        - More complex scope involving integration requirements
        - Still in requirements gathering phase (steps 5-6 of process)
- Financial structure already established - payment received before kickoff
    - Ashley tracking hours against pre-sold work allocation
    - Unusual setup splitting single engagement into sequential projects
- Historical context from previous agency NXT:
    - Client had existing lead scoring built entirely through workflows
    - Avoided HubSpot’s native lead scoring model (wasn’t robust when originally built)
    - All previous work labeled “lead scoring archive” in current system
    - Now transitioning to latest HubSpot lead scoring capabilities due to platform improvements
- Client-provided documentation approach:
    - Detailed lead scoring model document created before A8 engagement
        - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xcuj25QKsCnH0TRbFWnTzX-jnDekzNDM9833XadEZPU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.abcz0ay5q0n4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xcuj25QKsCnH0TRbFWnTzX-jnDekzNDM9833XadEZPU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.abcz0ay5q0n4)
    - Ashley adding implementation context rather than building model from scratch
    - Alan (key stakeholder) drove expansion beyond original sales adoption focus
    - Will attach client specifications to user stories for Amanda’s implementation team

### Documentation & Scoping Workflow Tools & Process

- Comprehensive gap analysis deliverable creation workflow:
    1. Ashley creates detailed user stories from client requirement workshops
