### Challenging Client Situation Resolution

- Yesterday’s high-stakes client call exceeded expectations
    
- Taryn’s strategic approach to angry client
    
    - Led with genuine apology and full accountability
        
    - “Thanks for taking time. I just want to apologize. You trust us to do this, and we didn’t do it well”
        
    - Emphasized personal 10-year company tenure and integrity commitment
        
    - Client completely surprised by humble approach vs expected defensive confrontation
        
- Key messaging framework used
    
    - “I’ve been here for ten years. I would hope you don’t do something if you don’t care about it for ten years”
        
    - “I hold the integrity of our company very high. It’s something I’m very passionate about”
        
    - “It doesn’t come lightly when I have a client upset”
        
    - When client asked for explanations: “Everything I tell you isn’t an excuse for you”
        
- Taryn’s unique strength in crisis management
    
    - Performs exceptionally well in high-pressure client scenarios
        
    - More nervous presenting to internal team than handling angry clients
        
    - Treats difficult conversations as “just two humans talking”
        
    - Natural ability to have genuine conversations without scripted pressure
        
- Current status: client relationship repaired, now requires execution and delivery
    

### User Story Development and AI Integration

- Practical training on user story creation using lead scoring example
    
- Sample user story breakdown
    
    - Epic: Sales agent productivity
        
    - User story: “As a sales agent, I want FreshJess to automatically score and rank prospects based on historical data so I can focus time on highest value opportunities”
        
    - Essentially requesting lead scoring functionality
        
- Acceptance criteria methodology
    
    - Base criteria on client interview insights and stated priorities
        
    - Example client preference: demographic data over behavioral data
        
        - Cares about: job title, location, industry
            
        - Doesn’t prioritize: email behavior (clicks, opens)
            
    - Acceptance criteria becomes: “Lead scoring based on demographic data of contact, scaled accordingly for sales routing and prospect weighting”
        
- Client case study shift: HubSpot to FreshSales
    
    - Original plan: HubSpot implementation for technology-agnostic client
        
    - Critical limitation discovered: HubSpot supports max 2,000 domains
        
    - Client requirement: 25,000 domains for SEO operations (legally validated but “sketchy” approach)
        
    - HubSpot confirmed inability to support requirement
        
    - Solution pivot: FreshSales overlay with existing FreshDesk system
        
    - Taryn acknowledged limited FreshSales expertise, committed to research and vendor calls
        
- AI integration philosophy
    
    - Use AI for heavy lifting but maintain fundamental understanding
        
    - AI limitations: accuracy issues and gap-filling problems
        
    - Human oversight essential for spot-checking and refinement
        
    - Example: AI might identify customer intelligence and lead scoring but miss deal pipeline automation
        
    - Team approach: rest on AI capabilities but review with “fine tooth comb”
        

### Comprehensive Implementation Methodology

- Detailed project scoping example shared via Slack for comparison
    
- Complete implementation workflow structure
    
    1. Initial account configuration
        
        - Time zone, currency, branding setup
            
        - Enable duplicate management
            
        - Connect email sending domain (MDI integrations)
            
    2. Page layout and customization
        
        - Red flag noted: not fully defined during strategy phase due to client timeline pressure
            
        - Requires first workshop with implementation team to define custom page layouts
            
    3. Data audit and migration process
        
        - Export all data from legacy system (Copper CRM in example)
            
        - Create comprehensive data mapping document
            
        - Map Copper fields to HubSpot standard and custom properties
            
        - Identify gaps requiring new custom properties
            
        - Determine data cleanup responsibility (typically client-side)
            
        - Small record count exception: team handled cleanup due to minimal data volume
            
    4. Technical data setup sequence
        
        - Set up properties in HubSpot
            
        - Clean up data: deduplicate records, reformat fields (dates, picklists)
            
        - Ensure dropdown/text field consistency
            
        - Import data with proper validation
            
        - Conduct thorough QA and post-import validation
            
    5. Training program specification
        
        - Currently missing: sales team not asking clients about training preferences
            
        - Example client specification: 2 sessions per team
            
        - Individual context noted: “Maria has used HubSpot in the past”
            
        - Implementation guidance: “Don’t mansplain HubSpot to her, focus on process gaps”
            
- Team structure and capabilities
    
    - Cross-functional consultant model: all team members handle multiple disciplines
        
    - Current example assignments:
        
        - Danny: training lead for traffic client
            
        - Jen: project management and session creation
            
        - J Lo (Jonathan Lopez): integrations and data work
            
        - Tom: technical integration and native workflow building
            
    - Universal capabilities: custom workflows, user permissions, training delivery
        
    - Agile task assignment based on project bandwidth and expertise needs
        
- Strategy development approach
    
    - Client interviews are foundation for all requirements
        
    - Interviewer limitation: “If they didn’t tell you something, you can’t scope something”
        
    - Human element expected: clients review scopes, delivery teams validate hours
        
    - Quality assurance: multiple review layers prevent single-point-of-failure
        
    - Realistic expectations: 15+ hours of client recordings will have gaps, corrections expected
