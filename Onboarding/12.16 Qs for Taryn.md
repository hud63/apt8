1. How do you want me to explain the boundary between the Speed-to-Lead customer stories (phase 1) and the broader requirements in the rough draft (phase 2) when stakeholders ask what’s included now vs. later?

2. How do tasks get assigned between Strategy and Michelle? Does she do that on her own or are we actually doing that?

3.  I see Project custom object, potential Parts custom object, and Distributor Bid custom object in the requirements. How do you decide when to recommend a custom object vs. using native HubSpot objects?
    - What's your typical approach to explaining custom object architecture to clients who aren't HubSpot experts?

4. Phase 1 (Speed to Lead) is ready for signature, but Phase 2 is still in requirements gathering. How do you manage the transition between phases when they're sold as one engagement?
    - Will Amanda's team start Phase 1 while you're still finalizing Phase 2 requirements?
