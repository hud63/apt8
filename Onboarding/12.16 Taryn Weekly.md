# 12.16 Mark <> Taryn - Weekly

Tue, 16 Dec 25

### Team & Project Updates

- Mark completing HubSpot certifications by tomorrow (high priority ones), giving himself leeway but expects completion today or tomorrow
- Taryn managing household situation - nanny developed migraine, had to send her home despite protests
    - Recognizes migraine symptoms from personal experience: dark circles around eyes, unfocused gaze, exhausted appearance
    - Discussion of migraine medication challenges: doctors prescribe preventative meds to take "when you feel it coming on" but symptoms only become apparent when migraine already present
    - Cannot get ahead of migraines effectively with current medical approach
- Kids disrupted meeting flow - both woke up screaming when nanny left, Taryn managing snacks and Paw Patrol during call
- Mark asking questions as usual, ready to dive into topics after completing certifications

### Solution Engineering Process & Structure

- Task creation workflow and ownership
    - Ashley creates overarching strategy tasks (e.g., "data and process gap analysis") with timeframes and assigns Michelle
    - Michelle independently creates subtasks as needed for herself
    - Primary purpose: bandwidth planning so Reed knows Michelle's allocation (e.g., "December, Michelle allocated to strategy project for x hours")
    - Michelle operates independently, even creating tasks mid-project when client requests arise
    - Example: Client requested sandbox demo, Michelle Slacked Taryn asking about available hours, created task herself
- Michelle's 360 feasibility assessment document deep dive
    - Requirements matrix methodology: tracks requirement source, project placement, HubSpot hub compatibility, suggested implementation path
    - Addresses fundamental feasibility question: "Can this be built in HubSpot?"
    - Document provides options with caveats: feasible but expensive, feasible but poor UX, feasible with specific limitations
    - Taryn's review process: ensures alignment with broader business process context, prevents SE tunnel vision on technical details
    - Client presentation protocol: Taryn schedules call, Michelle presents as SME with Taryn present for support
    - Back-and-forth dynamic: Michelle handles technical Q&A, client feedback, implementation details directly
- Custom objects decision framework complexity
    - Multiple consideration layers: system complexity, client technical sophistication, subscription tier limitations
    - Business case evaluation: reporting needs, usage frequency, integration impacts
    - Relationship mapping challenges: contact associations, deal connections, company-level tracking
    - Attribution model implications when adding new objects to existing workflows
    - Integration complexity: how custom objects affect middleware and external system connections
    - Example decision process: events object for attendance tracking vs. using existing course object for fundamentally different purposes
    - Collaborative pressure testing approach with Michelle, Ashley, or Taryn before client recommendations

### Client Strategy & Implementation Examples

- Sandbox demo standard practice evolution
    - RevPrep case study: building new data model with custom objects plus custom integration layers
    - Client preference for "seeing it happen" before major data model decisions
    - Michelle building actual demo in client sandbox after feasibility assessment approval
    - Taryn's philosophy: appreciates client trust but insists on validation for major system changes
- Phase structure approach and client drivers
    - TeoGlass example: client-initiated request for faster project start, knowing bigger issues remained
    - Abundance 360 case: Taryn proactively broke full project into phases for year-end delivery
        - Copied full project scope, extracted first few user stories for Phase 1
        - Worked around normal minimums and processes due to timing and known bandwidth
        - Pre-coordinated with Michelle on capacity and feasibility before selling
    - Generally client-driven based on timeline pressures, budget constraints, implementation speed needs
- Current pipeline status and prospects
    - Green Eggs: has sent scope, given verbal approval, but exhibiting hot/cold communication patterns
    - Multiple prospects likely rebooking meetings in January for rapid movement
    - JLG and others: larger companies with extended sales processes, could close January 1st or January 30th
    - February kickoff timeline possible for larger deals due to corporate decision-making cycles
    - Taryn hesitant to assign Mark to prospects until higher confidence in closure rates

### Service Boundaries & Expertise Areas

- Clear limitations on scope and capabilities
    - Avoid: CMS builds, portal design, custom website development on HubSpot CMS
    - Would decline: entire website build projects, refer to specialized vendors instead
    - Stay away from: hands-on configuration in external systems like NetSuite
- Core competencies and deliverables
    - Integration building and middleware development
    - Technical HubSpot implementations and system connections
    - Guidance and strategy for external builds without direct implementation
    - Example approach: "we'll handle HubSpot side and reporting, you need to hire CMS specialist for portal work"
- Strategy value in referral situations: can identify need for external specialists while handling HubSpot-specific components

### Outstanding Questions & Context Gaps

- TeoGlass email volume data mystery
    - Client provided detailed breakdown of email volume by inbox (CS team, customer service team)
    - Unclear why this data was requested vs. pulling directly from HubSpot access
    - Possible reasons: domain limits, email audit for volume reduction, distribution analysis
    - Mark noting no prior email discussion in documentation, flagging for Ashley clarification

### Next Steps

- Mark to complete HubSpot certifications by tomorrow (high priority ones)
- Mark to ask Ashley about context and reasoning behind TeoGlass email volume data request
- Tomorrow's call with Michelle to review feasibility assessment document in detail
- Taryn to notify Mark when pipeline prospects heat up for assignment and provide background notes
- Mark continuing to ask questions and gain exposure to different project pieces daily
- Pipeline monitoring for January prospect activity and rebooking patterns
