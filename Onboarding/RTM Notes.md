- **PS-330: Overcoming the "Fear of Selling"**
    
    - **Specific RTM Phrasing:** The course explicitly lists "Overcome the fear technical resources often have of up-selling" as a core objective.
        
    - **The Shift:** It teaches consultants to stop viewing "sales" as a transaction and start viewing it as "identifying value creation opportunities" to help the client succeed.
        
    - **Value Proposition:** It focuses on the formula for articulating value: **Relevance + Quantified Benefit + Differentiation**.
        
- **PS-320: The "Risk vs. Issue" Litmus Test**
    
    - **Specific RTM Phrasing:** The syllabus distinguishes between these two to prevent "alert fatigue."
        
    - **The Definition:**
        
        - **Risk:** Future uncertainty (Action = Mitigation).
            
        - **Issue:** Present reality (Action = Resolution).
            
    - **The Tool:** It emphasizes the use of an **Issues Log** (not just a status report) to track ownership and resolution dates specifically for active problems.
        
- **PS-210: "Trusted Advisor" & Stakeholder Mapping**
    
    - **Specific RTM Phrasing:** The course is built around the "Trusted Advisor" maturity model, moving you from a "Pair of Hands" (doer) to a strategic partner.
        
    - **Stakeholder Analysis:** It teaches you to "map" stakeholders into categories (e.g., **Champions** vs. **Detractors**) and create different communication plans for each rather than using a "one size fits all" approach.
        
- **PS-215: Structured Communication (The "Pyramid")**
    
    - **Specific RTM Phrasing:** The syllabus highlights "Developing and delivering key messages" and "Tools to plan and structure messages."
        
    - **The Technique:** This often refers to the **Minto Pyramid Principle** (standard in top-tier consulting), where you state the **Recommendation/Conclusion first**, then follow with supporting arguments, and end with data. This prevents "burying the lead" when talking to executives.
        
- **PS-325: Scope Creep vs. "Scope Gap"**
    
    - **Specific RTM Phrasing:** The training focuses on "handling situations when customers ask for more."
        
    - **The Tactic:** It teaches verbal scripts for "pushing back" without saying "no." Instead of rejecting a request, you explain the trade-off (e.g., "We can do X, but it will delay Y"), putting the choice back on the client.
        
- **PS-205: The "Symbiotic" PM Relationship**
    
    - **Specific RTM Phrasing:** Unlike generic PM training, this module focuses on **"How a PM supports you and how you can support your PM."**
        
    - **Key Behavior:** The training emphasizes that consultants must proactively "feed" the PM status updates and risk flags _before_ they are asked, rather than waiting to be managed.
        

### Summary of what makes this "RTM Specific":

While "Risk Management" is a general topic, **combining "Fear of Selling" with "Technical Consulting"** is a signature RTM approach (proven by their _PS University_ marketing). They specifically target the mindset of technical people who hate sales. Mentioning that specific psychological hurdle ("fear of up-selling") is the strongest proof you took _their_ specific course.
