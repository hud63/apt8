### Q4 Departmental Performance Overview

- Quarterly rocks tracking progress:
    1. Upsells and change orders - supporting overall company profit targets
    2. COGS management - currently at 70%, performing poorly
    3. Utilization rate - 72%, on track
    4. Capacity forecasting tool - being developed by Soraki
    5. Methodology rollout - on track, continuous refinement expected
    6. Strategy engagements - potentially hitting 2 of 3 target
    7. Case studies - in progress with marketing
    8. Client reviews - maintaining 100% positive feedback
    9. AI SKU development - Ashley working with client on strategy preparation

### Financial Performance and COGS Analysis

- Q4 showing $350k loss on enterprise projects (not missing target but actual loss)
    - Team working hard with good utilization, issue is project scoping and pricing
    - New revenue recognition model will amortize payments over project lifecycle
- Current challenges:
    - Inadequate initial scoping leading to scope creep
    - Write-offs reducing billable revenue
    - High cost of quality team members vs current blended rate structure
- Improvement strategies:
    1. Better upfront scoping and solution design
    2. Earlier scope adjustment conversations
    3. Potential move from blended to role-specific billing rates
    4. Phase-based pricing with higher strategy rates
    5. Stricter milestone tracking and budget monitoring

    - Noel’s UAT template proving very useful for Forest Brands

    - Need one-pager for pre-UAT client communication
- Change orders in progress:
    - Traffic requiring change order (positive for budget)
    - ETG and Warranty First trending toward change orders
- Warranty First major scope discussion:
    - MVP phase must be live by April
    - 80% of project now needs completion by April deadline
    - Michelle working with Reed on resource allocation
