### Enterprise Engagement Flow Structure

- Comprehensive engagement type mapping created
    
- Strategy engagements categorized by client status:
    
    - **Feasibility Assessments**: Clients deciding whether to purchase HubSpot
        
        - Examples: ASIS (HubSpot as AMS - advised against), VCC (Salesforce migration - rejected)
            
        - Output: yes/no decision with comprehensive documentation
            
        - May lead to separate implementation project via migration roadmap
            
    - **Strategic Consulting**: Rev ops brain-for-hire engagements
        
        - No guaranteed implementation component
            
        - Opportunity for sales conversion to implementation
            
    - **Optimization Assessments**: Existing long-term HubSpot users
        
        - Clients with outdated implementations missing new features
            
        - Specific needs: business units, custom objects, process optimization
            
        - Post-admin departure cleanup situations
            
- **Migration Roadmaps**: Strategy + known implementation path
    
    - Client already signed HubSpot contract
        
    - Strategy scoping first, implementation follows
        
    - American Derm example: strategy-only currently, implementation expected
        
- **Scoped Customer Stories**: Current standard enterprise work
    
- Methodology alignment between strategy and enterprise teams:
    
    - Identical process flow: mobilization → interviews → requirements → solution design → scoping
        
    - Strategy: creates net new requirements from scratch
        
    - Enterprise: validates and refines sales-provided requirements
        
    - Both culminate in solution design (workshops, TRDs, ERDs, business process maps)
        
- VIP engagement status for strategy clients (skip standard queue)
    
- Future structural considerations based on sales volume and COGS optimization
    

### Administrative & Planning Issues

- **AI Tool Usage Clarification Needed**
    
    - Confusion in AI Slack channel about Granola approval status
        
    - Some team members still using despite apparent restrictions
        
    - Privacy and AI training model implications possible
        
    - Terry to Slack Rob immediately for firm yes/no guidance
        
    - May require internal vs external usage distinctions
        
- **January Launch Coordination Critical**
    
    - Multiple major go-lives scheduled: Traffix, Brands, Acura
        
    - Terry’s annual Saint Thomas vacation during launch period
        
    - Resource allocation concerns with different project teams
        
    - Action: comprehensive launch timeline and responsibility mapping needed
        
    - Discussion scheduled for next week’s project meetings with Matt and Jen
        
    - Weekend launch requirements and compensation planning required
        
- **Elias Role Clarification**
    
    - New PM hire for increased enterprise capacity
        
    - Not dedicated strategy PM (clarification needed after yesterday’s confusion)
        
    - Will work across all engagement types as unified enterprise team
        
    - Future dedicated strategy PM possible based on sales volume growth

- A comprehensive enterprise engagement flow was outlined, detailing phases from feasibility assessments through strategy consulting to full-project scoping and implementation.
- Client timelines were adjusted when Trafix postponed their launch to January 23, which will trigger a change order as part of the contract.

### ![📝](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f4dd/32.png) Notes

#### Current Workflow

- Team members log review time via Clickup subtasks in the 'general to dos' section and tag managers (Terren and Brian) to record billable time with guidelines (approx. 20-30 minutes per review).
- Enterprise engagements follow a structured workflow involving feasibility assessments, discovery interviews, requirements gathering, solution design, and subsequently scoping for implementation.

#### Inefficiencies Observed

- Inconsistent permissions and access issues in Slack and Clickup sub lists create handoff challenges among team members.
- Clickup’s slow performance and differing user interface views (requiring 8 pages of scrolling) lead to time inefficiencies in task additions.

#### Key Stakeholders

- Sam Cressman, acting as the Account Manager, assists with client communications and internal Slack channel updates.
- Mark Cetola is a new team member who has been onboarded with a clear overview of roles and processes.
- Taryn Cleary serves as the meeting facilitator and process owner, providing lay of land and clarifying roles within the organization.
- Brian Serocke manages scorecards and drives the review process, tracking team utilization and guiding review time logging.
- Jen O'Connell and Matthew Scaramastra are Principal Consultants responsible for strategic consulting, project scoping, and implementation efforts.

#### Tools / Systems Used

- Slack serves as an internal communication tool; however, issues such as confusing channel names and access rights have been noted.
- Clickup is utilized for time logging, task management, and scorecard tracking, though users face performance and permission challenges.
- Hubspot and Salesforce are used for tracking engagement types and opportunities, with naming conventions indicating the engagement nature.

#### Root Causes Identified

- Inconsistent Clickup configurations, including varied saved views and permission settings, are causing slow performance and access issues.
- A lack of clear leadership communication regarding the use of the AI tool 'granola' has led to confusion among team members.

#### Proposed Improvements

- Standardize and update Clickup permissions and configurations to ensure consistent access and improved performance.
- Enforce clear time logging guidelines with proper task tagging in Clickup to ensure accurate business time awards.
- Obtain a clear directive from leadership on the approved use of the AI tool 'granola' to eliminate internal confusion.
- Clarify and standardize engagement type naming in Hubspot so that sales and project teams can quickly identify feasibility versus full-scale projects.

#### Impact

- Team utilization improved to 72.8% in November with a Q4 target set at 72.5% and an ultimate goal of a 75% baseline, which guides incentive structures.
- Enhanced process clarity and standardized workflows are expected to reduce inefficiencies in project reviews and improve workload distribution.

#### Metrics

- Team utilization is measured at 72.8% in November, aiming for a Q4 target of 72.5% and a baseline of 75% to trigger billable incentives.
- Review submission time is expected to be around 20 to 30 minutes per review, based on provided guidelines.

#### Risk

- The potential for resource strain is high during January client launches, with risks of weekend work and the need for additional compensation.
- Unclear policies regarding the use of the AI tool 'granola' pose a risk of privacy or training model issues if not addressed by leadership.

#### Change Order Processes

- Client-initiated delays, such as Trafix's postponed launch, trigger a change order process; scopes and deliverables must be clearly documented to support adjustments.

#### AI Tool Usage

- Confusion over usage of 'granola' was flagged; leadership must provide a definitive yes/no directive to address privacy and AI training concerns.

#### Project Management Roles

- Elias was hired to increase overall PM capacity across both strategy and enterprise engagements; no dedicated strategy PM role is assigned yet.
