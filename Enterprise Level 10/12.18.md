### Q1 Planning & Company Rocks
- Q1 rocks following quarterly planning meeting with Soraki yesterday:
    1. PC levels rollout - establish consultant level system (L2, L5, L6) for DL and PC roles by end of Q1
        - Currently missing growth level structure for these positions
        - Required for organizational advancement opportunities
    2. COGS improvement - working toward realistic targets after financial responsibility for client issues
        - Q1 won’t look great due to ongoing client write-offs
        - Setting achievable benchmarks rather than “fantastic” unrealistic goals
    3. Non-AE sales evaluation - quantifying deals sales team doesn’t handle
        - Focus on P2s, phase twos, change orders, and upsells
        - Categorizing enterprise vs core opportunities
        - Numbers to be finalized in next few business days
    4. 75% utilization target - up from current 73.8% Q4 performance
        - Previous Q4 goal was 72.5%
        - Strong pipeline supports higher target
        - Renewed focus on billable time tracking across practice
    5. Strategy for all enterprise deals - mandatory strategy phase before project start
        - Sales team already sending emails switching deals to strategy approach
        - Prevents discovering major scope overruns mid-project
        - Future: company-wide strategy rollout planned but not Q1 implementation
    6. Enterprise PM methodology definition - collaborative building effort
        - Soraki accountable, Noel and Elias responsible for input
        - Define PM ownership vs support responsibilities
        - Create guardrails for client interaction and execution
- Revenue recognition change for 2026:
    - Shift from contract-signing recognition to time-worked recognition
    - Time tracking becomes critical for monthly revenue booking
    - Write-offs and free hours directly impact COGS percentage
    - Affects ability to invest in staff, tools, and learning opportunities

### Client Escalations & Lessons Learned
- Warranty First crisis resolved after escalation Monday with Charlie
    - Client concerns: “Why didn’t you tell me during these six months?” and improper scoping
    - Morning call included Matt, Megan, and accountability discussions
    - Missing strategy review step between strategy and presentation identified
    - Prevents clients being blindsided by unexpected project scope
- Escalation management insights:
    - Emotional clients harder to handle than angry ones
    - Early communication protocols need strengthening across all projects
    - Sales team attempted strategy engagement initially but client declined
- Company financial context:
    - $2M in write-offs impacting COGS but company remains profitable
    - Still investing in team growth, potentially new January hire
    - Transparency shared to ensure team awareness without causing worry

### Team Development & Onboarding
- Elias comprehensive onboarding plan:
    - Added to Forest Brands weekly sprint tomorrow morning
    - Traffics Monday call and Friday PM-specific meeting
    - Shadow all possible client meetings for tone, communication learning
    - Warranty First P2 scope work participation with Jen
- Process improvement initiatives:
    - PM biweekly jam sessions restart January 8
    - Focus on continuous process improvement and efficiency tools
    - Centralized collaboration document needed in project management work folder
    - Goal: package improvements into Guru cards for methodology documentation
- Resource allocation:
    - All client meeting attendance won’t charge project budgets during learning phase
    - Calendar will “blow up” initially but adjust as Elias becomes fully utilized
    - Noel’s PM methodology drive: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10OTM5iCxhbGSXQkGm_Nixeg5erLwcrRv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10OTM5iCxhbGSXQkGm_Nixeg5erLwcrRv)

### Rocket Lane Project Structure Implementation
- Transition from ClickUp “Wild West” to standardized Rocket Lane structure
- Current problems: unlimited subtask nesting, tasks getting buried, difficult project plan visibility
- New hierarchical structure:
    - Accounts = clients (equivalent to ClickUp spaces)
    - Projects = individual engagements (equivalent to ClickUp folders)
    - Phases = methodology stages (replaces work streams)
    - Tasks = deliverables within phases
    - Subtasks = execution items (limited to one level only)
- Resource management improvements:
    - Hard bookings: actual assigned task time
    - Soft allocations: manual capacity planning (e.g., “Matt 6 hours ETG week of January 5”)
    - Pipeline capacity visibility for March planning and beyond
    - Dependencies between tasks for sequential work planning
- Project phases aligned to enterprise methodology:
    1. Requirements - workshops for each work stream (Sales Hub, Salesforce integration)
    2. Solution Design - process maps, BRDs, TRDs, field mappings per work stream
    3. Implementation - actual building (properties, pipelines, workflows)
    4. Testing - test cases, QA, UAT structure
    5. Training - potentially reorganized by product (Sales Hub, Marketing Hub) vs work stream
    6. Documentation - proposed as separate phase rather than embedded

### Documentation & Deliverable Concerns
- Client feedback pattern: “too many documents” from enterprise clients
    - TRDs extremely long with multiple tabs
    - RTMs questioned as end-of-phase deliverables
    - Multiple supporting docs (Lucid charts, API info, field mappings) overwhelming
- Proposed solutions:
    - Visual presentations using Claude AI for executive summaries
    - Trumpet access for centralized client deliverable portal
    - Technical documentation still required for dev handoffs and client approvals
    - ASIS example: 104-page document likely unread by client
- Real-time documentation approach:
    - Document immediately after completing each work stream task
    - Example: “Build pipeline” followed by “Document pipeline” subtask
    - Create master workbook with HubSpot asset links throughout project
    - Deliver comprehensive implementation guide as final deliverable
    - PM responsibility to store documentation centrally for knowledge transfer

### Implementation & Methodology Challenges
- Sandbox vs production workflow integration:
    - Current challenge: tasks completed in sandbox require recreation for production
    - Multiple client pushes need accommodation in initial project planning
    - Solution: task naming convention (e.g., “Build pipeline - Sandbox” then deployment tasks)
    - Some projects build directly in production for net-new HubSpot customers
- Training structure optimization:
    - Debate: work stream structure vs product delivery approach
    - Proposed: Train-the-trainer, Sales Hub training, Marketing Hub training separately
    - End user training organized by hub rather than work stream
- Process efficiency opportunities:
    - Repetitive work across testing, training, UAT, and documentation phases
    - Potential 50-75% efficiency gains through standardized approach
    - Documentation always relegated to project end despite earlier completion possibility
    - Need for backup assignee collaboration on all work streams for knowledge transfer

### Next Steps
- Finalize Rocket Lane project structure feedback by start of 2025
- ETG change order conversation rescheduled to tomorrow 9 AM (moved from today)
- Revenue and SA team alignment on new scoping methodology following task structure
- Centralized process improvement document creation for Q1 methodology rock
- Team review of shared project structure document with comments and input
