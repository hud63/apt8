**Workflow & Task Management for Fundraising Teams**

* Role-Based Coordination – Coordinators and project managers assign tasks, set deadlines, and monitor progress across campaigns, appeals, grants, and events.
* Team Collaboration Tools – Inline notes, @mentions, shared calendars, and file attachments keep updates in one place—eliminating email silos.
* Workflow Automation – Auto-create tasks (e.g., “Send Agreement” when a proposal moves to *Under Agreement*) and trigger approvals based on pipeline stage.
* Fundraiser Dashboards – Each staffer sees tasks, prospects, revenue thermometer, and goal progress at a glance.
* Ease of use: Intuitive interface for non-technical users.

**Terminology Alignment & Mapping Guide (Raiser’s Edge NXT)**

As we evaluate and plan for a potential transition from Raiser’s Edge NXT to HubSpot, it’s important to document the key terminology and data structures we currently rely on and what would be on our wish list to enhance. These terms form the foundation of how we report, track, and manage our fundraising efforts. Any future CRM must allow us to retain or replicate the following elements:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Raiser’s Edge Term | Purpose / Use |
| Linked Appeals | Allows roll-up and association between parent/child appeals within a campaign. Essential for tracking progress and reporting across multiple entry points. |
| Top Appeals | Automatically ranks appeals by revenue to show performance trends and priorities. |
| Campaign | Higher-level funding initiative under which appeals and gifts are categorized (e.g., Annual Giving, JAAD). |
| Top Donors (Corporate & Individual) | Identifies highest contributors by category and fiscal year—used in stewardship, reporting, and pipeline strategy. |
| Top Funds (Corporate & Individual) | Highlights the most-supported programs or initiatives by funding totals. |
| Gifts by Constituent Code | Enables segmented reporting by type of donor (e.g., Corporate, Foundation, Individual, Member). |
| Linked Events (Corporate & Individual) | Connects fundraising and stewardship activities directly to event attendance and participation. |
| Donors by Giving Level | Tracks giving tiers across both corporate and individual segments for recognition and targeted campaigns. |
| Gifts by All Types | Supports reporting by method or classification—cash, pledge, in-kind, stock, etc. |
| Gifts by Giving Level | Breaks out donor impact across predefined levels (e.g., $500–$999, $1,000–$4,999) used in appeals and board reports. |

**System Integration Needs & Wishlist**

As part of our CRM transition planning, it’s essential that the new system supports integrations with the platforms we rely on for daily operations and cross-functional collaboration. The following systems should be prioritized for integration:

* **Aptify**
* **Sage Intacct**
* **Monday.com**
* **Outlook**
* **Slack**
* **Event Platform (pending)**
* **Zoom**
