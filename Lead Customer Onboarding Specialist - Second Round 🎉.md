## **Interview Format (45 minutes)**

* Overview: 5 minutes  
* Kick-off Call Role-Play: 25 minutes  
* Technical & Process Q\&A: 10 minutes  
* Your Questions: 5 minutes

**You’ll find the Hapana role-play prompt attached. Slide deck or presentation materials are NOT required — we want to hear how you think and communicate, not see a polished deck. If you prefer to have a deck prepared as a guide, that is fine too \- whatever works best for you\!** 

## **How to Prepare (Important)**

Based on common areas where candidates have struggled, please focus on:

### **1\. Strong discovery & active listening**

* Ask clarifying and follow-up questions (e.g., “What does success look like?”).

* Don’t jump straight to HubSpot features before understanding the customer’s goals and processes.

### **2\. Technical awareness (high-level is totally fine)**

* Be ready to discuss concepts like APIs, integrations, CRM structure, workflows, and light CSS basics.

* Show curiosity about the customer’s systems and data flow.

### **3\. Business-first thinking**

* Connect HubSpot tools to business outcomes.

* Guide the customer through ambiguity and low marketing maturity.

### **4\. Practical AI use cases**

* Share simple, business-focused AI applications, such as content generation, workflow support, or lead qualification assistance.
